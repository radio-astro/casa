// </prerequisite>
//
// <etymology>
// This class implements convolution within the LinearEquation framework.
// </etymology>
//
// <synopsis>
// This class is used in conjunction with classes like HogbomCleanModel to
// implement deconvolution algorithms. This class contains the point spread
// function (psf) and the convolved data (dirty image), and is able to
// convolve a supplied model with the psf to produce a predicted output
// (using the evaluate() function), or to subtract the convolved data and
// produce a residual (using the residual() function).
//
// See the documentation for 
// <linkto class=HogbomCleanModel>HogbomCleanModel</linkto> 
// for an example of how this class can be used to perform deconvolution.
//
// This class also contains specialised functions (like the version of
// evaluate() for a point source model) that speed up the calculation of the
// convolution. This specialised version of evaluate() does not need to
// actually perform the convolution and instead returns a suitable part of
// the psf (zero padded if necessary). When this function is called this
// class will get the psf from the convolver and cache it, on the assumption
// that many evaluations of this function will be requested (as occurs in
// Clean algorithms). 
// 
// The size and shape of the psf and the supplied model may be different. The
// only restriction is that the dimension of the psf must be less than or
// equal to the dimension of the model. If the dimension of the
// model is larger than the dimension of the psf then the convolution
// will be repeated along the slowest moving (last) axis. The dirty image
// and the supplied model must be the same size and shape. 
//
// This class can also operate on MaskedArrays (and models representable by
// MaskedArrays). But the mask is currently discarded and the convolution
// performed on the entire supplied model. This may change in the future.
//
// </synopsis>
//
// <example>
// <srcblock>
// Matrix<Float> psf(4,4), dirty(20,20), model(20,20);
// .... put some meaningful values into these Arrays....
// // create a convolution equation, and an array model
// ConvolutionEquation convEqn(psf, dirty);
// ArrayModel<Float> myModel(model);
// // now calculate the convolution of the model and the psf
// Matrix<Float> prediction;
// convEqn.evaluate(myModel, prediction);
// // and calculate the difference between the predicted and actual convolution
// Matrix<Float> residual;
// convEqn.residual(mymodel, residual)
// </srcblock>
// </example>
//
// <motivation>
// This class was designed with deconvolution in mind. 
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="1990/05/03">
//   <li> Fix up the way this class works for other data types. 
//        It currently can handle Arrays of Floats only.
//        I do not intend to extend it to handle Double, Complex, & DComplex
//        until there is a demand.
//   <li> This class is not templated. If necessary I would use templating
//        to produce a Double Precision Version.
// </todo>
