Release Version 2.1.0 [2006-09-11]

* Processing of Multibeam MX data
* Line Catalogs for both plotting and setting rest frequencies
* median averaging
* support of circular polarisations
* binaries for fedora (core 3/5), debian, ubuntu, OSX (ppc,intel)
* text/arrow/line annonations for plotter
* export of fit parameters to text file

Release Version 2.0 [2006-04-28]

* Major rework of internal data representation. Now supports IFs with
  different number of spectral channels. This has minimal effect on the
  user interface.
* Creation of a "selector" object used for data selection. Allow slicing of
  data in beam, IF, polarisation as well as selection via header values
  (e.g. Tsys). set_cursor is now invalid use set_selection instead.
* Scantables can be merged
* scantable.lines() has been removed. Set rest frequencies by value
  (This will change in 2.1)
* Multiple data files (e.g. rpf) can be read into a single scantable
* Polarmetric infrastructure improved to support most observing styles
  (linear feeds only)
* ability to convert to/store as Stokes
* Plotter can now only plot from a single scantable (use merge if necessary)
* ASCII (text) spectral output changed to be more usable
* Can change the source position coordinate frame
* Bug fixes
* auto_quotient is doing "closest in time reference"
* option auto-align in velocity when using average_time
* flagging on a per channel base


(Release 1.2.2)

* channel based flagging
* Added get_elevation, azimuth and parangle
* Added swap_lineas & invert_phase
* added allaxes arg to poly_baseline
* Request: added pager throuput for history and summary
* Request: Log meesage on auto_quotient()
* Bug Fix: plotter -set_mode("s","i").
* Bug fix: plotter -autoscale abcissa limits from all spectra for stacking.

Release Version 1.2.1 [2005-12-06]

* scantable.recalc_azel - recalcualte azimuth and elevation based on
* pointing Bug fix: plotter - set_layout got overwritten byt plot; row
  cursor not honoured in _plot_time


Release Version 1.2 [2005-11-30]

Code changes
------------
* frequency switching: scantable.freq_switch()
* get a list of sourcenames: scantable.get_sourcename()
* build quotients from matched _S/_R pairs or 1*_R/n*_S automatically
* plotting control: plotter.set_colors(), plotter.set_linestyles(),
  plotter.set_linewidth() all also  via .asaprc parameters
* non-interactive (non-GUI) plotting
* ASAP Online (Mopra) Monitor web interface (mini pipeline)
* user control of multi-panel: plotter.set_layout()
* histogram plotting: part of linestyles
* plugins: via ~/.asap/userfuncs.py
* plotter panel control: rcParams['plotter.ganged']
* usability: reworked the whole asap startup scripts, now all user adjustable
  through ~/.asap/

Todos/pending
--------------
* documentation update: should be finished by 2005-11-25
* cookbook
* release 1.2:  2005-11-30

Major non-targets, resulting from requirements/targets
-----------------------------------------------------
* asap logging, which can be turned on and off through .asaprc/rcParams
 (from asapmon)
* Data container v2 design study and document ( moved from cycle II )

Not Addressed
-------------

(deferred to cycle II, as described in support document)

* Flexible data selection
* "Merging of spectra" (concatenating scantables)

* public defect tracking system
