// <synopsis> 

// This class is designed to read VLA archive data.  The data may be read from
// a disk, tape drive or any other data source supported by the IO module.  A
// call to the operator++() function assembles the next reconstructed VLA
// archive data record from the input. A reference to this data can be
// obtained using the logicalRecord function.
//
// Refer to the "VLA Archive Data Format", VLA Computer Memorandum 186
// by G.C. Hunt, K.P. Sowinski, and T.J. Bottomly; June 1993.
// (This is also available as AIPS++ note 159)
//
// The VLA archive records are always a multiple of 2048 bytes.  The
// record sizes were designed for use with magnetic tapes, so there is
// a maximum physical record size of 13*2048=26624 bytes.
//
// The low level class (blockio), that actually does the I/O, allows
// for a record (hereinafter chunk) size and for a input block size of
// a multiple of the chunk size.  The low level read operation tests
// for the number of bytes actually read from the device.
//
// The helper classes VlaDiskInput, VlaTapeInput, and VlaStdInput are
// designed to deal with the low level input from the devices in an
// analogous fashion to the ones used for FITS input.
//
// Since a read may be issued for an arbitrary number of bytes from a
// disk, the chunk multiple is arbitrary and may be used to tune the
// speed of operation.  There is an obvious trade-off between the
// block size created in the blockio class and the number of read
// operations.
//
// The story is quite different for tape input.  A read request for at
// least the maximum physical record size must be made to avoid loss of
// data.  Since a single tape record will be read with a single read
// operation, there is no point is having it any larger.  The chunk
// multiple must be exactly 13 so that the block size is 26624.
//
// The reconstitution algorithm is as follows:
//
// 1. Read a 2048 chunk from the input.
//
// The first two 16-bit integers should contain the values 1 and n,
// where n is the number of "physical records" in the current "logical  
// record."  (If the first value is not 1, then the chunk is rejected
// and a new one read until the first 16-bit value is 1.)  These two
// values are not part of the reconstituted "logical record."
//
// 2. The next 32-bit integer contains the length of the "logical
// record" in 16-bit words.  The buffer is resized so that it can
// contain the whole reconstituted "logical record."
//
// 3. The remainder of the chunk is copied to the buffer.
//
// 4. Successive chunks are read from the input.
//
// The chunks are copied into the buffer until the "logical record"
// is complete.  For "logical records" longer than 26620 byte, this is
// not the whole story.  Each "physical record" contains maximum of 13
// chunks.  When the first "physical record" of 13 chunks has been read,
// the next chunk will be the first of the next "physical record."  The
// first two 16-bit integers will now be 2 and n, to indicate that this
// is the second "physical record" of the sequence.  These 4 bytes are
// decoded and the rest of this chunk is copied to the buffer.  And so
// on...
//
// An end-of-file condition on the input will cause record processing
// to be declared complete.  
// </synopsis> 
//
// <example>
// To open and read a VLA archive data file
// <code>
//    VLAArchiveInput *in;
//    Block <Char> *buff;
//    String fileName = " ";
//    String fileType = "tape";
//
//    if (fileType == String("tape")) {
//        in = new VLAArchiveInput(fileName.chars(), VLAArchiveInput::Tape);
//    } else {
//        in = new VLAArchiveInput(fileName.chars(), VLAArchiveInput::Disk);
//    }
//
//    uInt record = 0;
//    for (buff=&(in->next()); in->atEnd()==False; buff=&(in->next()), record++) {
//        cout << "Record" << record << endl;
//        // process record pointed to by buff
//    }
// </code>

//   <li> Bulletproofing - check for realistic buffer size (<1e6)
//   <li> Bulletproofing - check newn and newm on each read
//   <li> What happens after a single end-of-file on a tape drive?
