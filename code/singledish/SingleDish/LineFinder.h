      Find spectral lines of a spectrum using a threshold based on median
      absolute deviation (MAD).
      The median of lower 80% of MAD values are used to define the
      threshold of line channels.

      num_data : the number of elements in data and mask vector.
      data : a float vector of data to detect lines. should be aligned.
      mask : a boolean vector which indecates if the corresponding elements
             in data should be used in line detection.
	     Note mask is modified in the function. Edge channels are masked.
      threshold: a multiplication factor to define threshold.
      max_iteration : the maximum number of iteration to detect line,
                      and eliminate the line channels to redefine MAD array.
      minwidth : minimum line width (in channel) to detect as lines
      maxwidth : maximum line width (in channel) to detect as lines
      avg_limit : maximum width of channel binning to run line detection.
      edge : the number of elements at the begining and end of data array
             that should be ignored in line detection.

      [overview of line detection algorithm]
      1. Median absolute deviation of each data element is calculated and 
         defined as MAD array.
      2. Calculate median of MAD array. Only lower 80% of valid elements
         (mask=true and not in lines) are used to calculate the value.
      3. Compare each element of MAD array and the product of
         threshold and median of MAD. Elements that exceeds
	 the threshold value are detected as channels.
      4. Line range modifications,e.g., extend line ranges for wing component,
         merge overlapping lines, and check if line meets maxwidth and
	 minwidth criteria.
      5. Go to step 1 and repeat line detection by removing line channels
         from MAD calculations. stop iteration either if loop reaches
	 max_iteration, no lines found in the bin level, no new line channel
	 is detected, or MAD threshold increased compared to the previous
	 iteration.
      6. bin data with 4 times coarser width and repeat line detection again
         untill bin width reaches to avg_limit.
         Merge line ranges detected in the current bin level to previous
	 result.
