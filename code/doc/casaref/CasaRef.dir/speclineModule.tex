\noindent{\bf Description} 

This module contains functionality to access 
spectral-line Splatalogue line list.

\noindent The available tools in this module are

\begin{itemize}

\item \ahlink{spectralline}{spectralline:spectralline} - 
In order for the spectralline tool to be able to search
Splatalogue a splatalogue line list, an ascii version of a line list must be exported
using the splatalogue web interface and then converted to a CASA table. The method
splattotable does this conversion.
