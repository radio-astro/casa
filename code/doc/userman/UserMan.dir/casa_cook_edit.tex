\section{Plotting and Flagging Visibility Data in CASA}
\label{section:edit.intro}

The tasks available for plotting and flagging of data are:
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt flagmanager} --- manage versions of data flags
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagmanager})
   \item {\tt plotms} --- create X-Y plots of data in MS and
     calibration tables, flag data
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms})
   \item {\tt plotxy} --- older X-Y plotter with some functionalities not yet implemented in \tt{plotms}
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy})
    \item {\tt flagdata} --- Data Flagging 
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagdata})
   \item {\tt flagcmd} --- manipulate and apply flags using {\tt FLAG\_CMD} table
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd})
  \item {\tt browsetable} --- browse data in any CASA table (including a MS)
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.browse})
   \item {\tt plotants} --- create simple plots of antenna positions
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotants})
  \item {\tt plotuv} --- plotting of uv-coverages
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotuv})
\end{itemize}

The following sections describe the use of these tasks.
%[SHOULD WE STRESS VIEWER MORE HERE? as an AIPS user, i found it hard to figure out what the parallels to tvflg and spflg are from this cookbook, because viewer hardly gets mentioned here. the viewer chapter is placed way at the end of the cookbook, almost like an afterthought.]

Information on other related operations can be found in:
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt listobs} --- list summary of a MS (\S~\ref{section:io.list})
   \item {\tt listvis} --- list data in a MS (\S~\ref{section:io.vis.listvis})
   \item {\tt selectdata} --- general data selection syntax
      (\S~\ref{section:io.selection})
   \item {\tt viewer} --- use the {\tt casaviewer} to display the MS as a 
      raster image, and flag it (\S~\ref{chapter:display})

\end{itemize}

\section{Managing flag versions with {\tt flagmanager}}
\label{section:edit.flagmanager}

The {\tt flagmanager} task will allow you to manage different
versions of flags in your data.  These are stored inside a CASA
flagversions table, under the name of the MS {\tt
  <msname>.flagversions}. 
For example, for the MS {\tt jupiter6cm.usecase.ms}, there will need
to be {\tt jupiter6cm.usecase.ms.flagversions} on disk.  This is
created on import (by {\tt importvla} or {\tt importuvfits}) or
when flagging is first done on an MS without a {\tt .flagversions}
(e.g. with {\tt plotxy}).  

By default, when the {\tt .flagversions} is created, this
directory will contain a {\tt flags.Original} in it containing
a copy of the original flags in the {\tt MAIN} table of the MS
so that you have a backup.  It will also contain a file called
{\tt FLAG\_VERSION\_LIST} that has the information on the various
flag versions there. The {\tt flagversions} are cumulative, ie. a
specific version number contains all the flags from the lower version
numbers, too. 

The inputs for {\tt flagmanager} are:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
vis                 =         ''        #   Name of input visibility file (MS)
mode                =     'list'        #   Flag management operation (list,save,restore,delete)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The {\tt mode='list'} option will list the available flagversions from
the {\tt <msname>.flagversions} file.  For example:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <102>: default('flagmanager')
CASA <103>: vis = 'jupiter6cm.usecase.ms'
CASA <104>: mode = 'list'
CASA <105>: flagmanager()
MS : /home/imager-b/smyers/Oct07/jupiter6cm.usecase.ms

main : working copy in main table
Original : Original flags at import into CASA
flagautocorr : flagged autocorr
xyflags : Plotxy flags
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The {\tt mode} parameter expands the options.  For example, if you wish to 
save the current flagging state of {\tt vis=<msname>}, 
\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =     'save'        #   Flag management operation (list,save,restore,delete)
     versionname    =         ''        #   Name of flag version (no spaces)
     comment        =         ''        #   Short description of flag version
     merge          =  'replace'        #   Merge option (replace, and, or)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
with the output version name specified by {\tt versionname}.  For example, the
above {\tt xyflags} version was written using:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   default('flagmanager')
   vis = 'jupiter6cm.usecase.ms'
   mode = 'save'
   versionname = 'xyflags'
   comment = 'Plotxy flags'
   flagmanager()
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
and you can see that there is now a sub-table in the flagversions directory
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <106>: ls jupiter6cm.usecase.ms.flagversions/
  IPython system call: ls -F jupiter6cm.usecase.ms.flagversions/
  flags.flagautocorr  flags.Original  flags.xyflags  FLAG_VERSION_LIST
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize
{\bf It is recommended that you use this facility regularly to save versions
during flagging.}

You can restore a previously saved set of flags using the 
{\tt mode='restore'} option:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =  'restore'        #   Flag management operation (list,save,restore,delete)
     versionname    =         ''        #   Name of flag version (no spaces)
     merge          =  'replace'        #   Merge option (replace, and, or)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The {\tt merge} sub-parameter will control how the flags are restored.  
For {\tt merge='replace'}, the flags in {\tt versionname} will replace those
in the MAIN table of the MS.  For {\tt merge='and'}, only data that is
flagged in BOTH the current MAIN table and in {\tt versionname} will 
be flagged.  For {\tt merge='or'}, data flagged in EITHER the MAIN or
in {\tt versionname} will be flagged.

The {\tt mode='delete'} option can be used to remove {\tt versionname} from the
flagversions:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =   'delete'        #   Flag management operation (list,save,restore,delete)
     versionname     =         ''       #   Name of flag version (no spaces)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{X-Y Plotting and Editing of the Data}
\label{section:edit.plot}

There are three main X-Y plotting tasks in CASA:
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt plotms} --- create X-Y plots of data in MS, flag data
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms})
   \item {\tt plotxy} --- older X-Y plotter with some functionalities not yet implemented in {\tt plotms}
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy})
   \item {\tt plotants} --- create simple plots of antenna positions
      (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotants})
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{MS Plotting and Editing using {\tt plotms}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms}

The principal way to get X-Y plots of visibility data and calibration
tables is the {\tt
  plotms} task. This task also provides editing capability. {\tt
  Plotms} is a GUI-style plotter, based on Qt
(\url{http://www.trolltech.com/qt}). It can either be started as a
task within CASA ({\tt plotms}) or from outside CASA (type {\tt
  casaplotms} on the command line).

The current inputs to the {\tt plotms} task are:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#  plotms :: A plotter/interactive flagger for visibility data.

                                        #   scans?
     avgfield       =      False        #  only valid if time averaging is turned on.  average over

                                        #   avgantenna)
     avgantenna     =      False        #  average by per-antenna?  (mutually exclusive with
                                        #   avgbaseline)
     avgspw         =      False        #  average over all spectral windows?

plotfile            =         ''        #  Name of plot file to save automatically.
async               =      False        #  If true the taskname must be started using plotms(...)

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize All of these parameters can also be set or modified from
inside the {\tt plotms} window. Note that, if the {\tt vis} parameter
is set to the name of a measurement or calibration table set here, when you start up {\tt
  plotms}, the {\it entire} measurement set will be plotted, which can
be time consuming. It is probably best to leave all parameters blank
for now, setting them as needed inside the {\tt plotms} GUI.

  \ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}.}
\hrulefill

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Loading and Selecting Data}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.select}

When {\tt plotms} is first started, a window will appear as in Figure
\ref{fig:plotms_empty}. It will, by default, display the {\bf Plots}
tab (as chosen from the tabs at the top of the {\tt plotms}
window---e.g., {\bf Plots, Flagging, Tools}...) and the {\bf Plots $>$
  Data} tab (as chosen from the tabs on the far left side of the {\tt
  plotms} window---e.g., {\bf Data, Axes, Trans, Iter}...). First, a
measurement set should be loaded by clicking on {\bf Browse} near the
top of the {\bf Plots $>$ Data} tab, and selecting a {\tt .ms}
directory (just select the directory itself; do not descend into the
{\tt .ms} directory). A plot can now be made of the measurement set by
clicking on {\bf Plot}---but beware, this would plot the entire
measurement set, and could take quite some time! It is probably better
to select a subset of the measurement set using the {\bf Selection}
windows in the {\bf Plots $>$ Data} tab before clicking {\bf
  Plot}. 

The options for data selection are:
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf field}
   \item {\bf spw}
   \item {\bf timerange}
   \item {\bf uvrange}
   \item {\bf antenna}
   \item {\bf scan}
   \item {\bf corr}
   \item {\bf array}
   \item {\bf msselect}
\end{itemize}
These are described in \S~\ref{section:io.selection}. Note that,
unlike when setting data selection parameters from the CASA command
line, no quotation marks are needed around strings.

When a plotting parameter has been changed, it will turn red (for
example, when a new measurement set is loaded, {\bf File Location}
turns red). This alerts the user that, if the {\bf Plot} button is
clicked, a change will be made to the displayed plot.

Once you have selected the desired subset of data, if you click {\bf
  Plot}, {\tt plotms} will by default plot amplitude versus time. See
the next section for information about other possible axes.

For a given data selection, {\tt plotms} will only load the data
once. This speeds up plotting considerably when changing plot
parameters such as different axes, colors etc. Sometimes, however,
the data changes on disk, e.g., when other data processing tasks were
applied. To force {\tt plotms} to reload the data, checkmark the
little {\bf force reload} box left to the {\bf Plot'} button or press
the {\tt SHIFT} key while clicking the {\bf Plot} button.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{A Brief Note Regarding {\tt plotms} Memory Usage}

In order to provide a wide range of flexible interactive plotting
options while minimizing the I/O burden, {\tt plotms} caches the data
values for the plot (along with a subset of relevant meta-info) in as
efficient a manner as possible.  For plots of large numbers of points,
the total memory requirement can be quite large. {\tt plotms} attempts
to predict the memory it will require (typically 5 or 6 bytes per
plotted point when only one axis is a data axis, depending upon the
data shapes involved), and will complain if it believes there is
insufficient memory to support the requested plot.  For most practical
interactive purposes (plots that load and draw in less than a few or a
few 10s of minutes), there is usually not a problem on typical modern
workstations (attempts to plot large datasets on small laptops might
be more likely to encounter problems here).

The absolute upper limit on the number of simultaneously plotted points
is currently set by the ability to index the points in the
cache.  For modern 64 bit machines, this is about 4.29 billion
points (requiring around 25GB of memory).   (Such plots are
not especially useful interactively, since the I/O and draw
become prohibitive.)

In general, it is usually most efficient to plot data in modest
chunks of not more than a few hundred million points or less,
either using selection or averaging.  Note that all iterations
are (currently) cached simultaneously for iterated plots, so 
iteration is not a way to manage memory use.  A few hundred
million points tends to be the practical limit of interactive
{\tt plotms} use w.r.t. information content and utility in the 
resulting plots, especially when you consider the number of available
pixels on your screen.  

Since datasets are growing very large, options for plotting
arbitrarily large numbers of points---probably in a 
non-interactive mode---are under consideration for a future release.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Plot Axes}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.axes}

The X and Y axes of a plot are selected by clicking on the {\bf Plots $>$ Axes} tab on the left side of the {\tt plotms} window, and choosing an entry from the drop-down menus below {\bf X Axis} and {\bf Y Axis} (see Figure \ref{fig:plotms_axes}). Possible axes are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Scan} --- The scan number, as listed by {\tt listobs} (\S~\ref{section:io.list}) or the data summary in {\tt plotms} (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}).

\item {\bf Field} --- The field number, as listed by {\tt listobs} (\S~\ref{section:io.list}) or the {\tt plotms} data summary (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}).

\item {\bf Time} --- The time at which the visibility was observed, given in terms of calendar year (yyyy/mm/dd/hh:mm:ss.ss).

\item {\bf Time\_interval} --- The integration time in seconds.

\item {\bf Spw} --- The spectral window number. The characteristics of each spectral window are listed in {\tt listobs} (\S~\ref{section:io.list}) or the {\tt plotms} data summary (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}).

\item {\bf Channel} --- The spectral channel number.

\item {\bf Frequency} --- Frequency in units of GHz. The frame for the frequency (e.g., topocentric, barycentric, LSRK) can be set in the {\bf Plots $>$ Trans} tab (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.trans}).

\item {\bf Velocity} --- Velocity in units of km s$^-1$, as defined by the {\bf Frame}, {\bf Velocity Defn}, and {\bf Rest Freq} parameters in the {\bf Plots $>$ Trans} tab (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.trans}).

\item {\bf Corr} --- Correlations which have been assigned integer IDs:  5 = RR; 6 = RL; 7 = LR; and 8 = LL.

\item {\bf Antenna1} --- The first antenna in a baseline pair; for example, for baseline 2-4, Antenna1 = 2. Antennae are numbered according to the antenna IDs listed in {\tt listobs} (\S~\ref{section:io.list}) or the {\tt plotms} data summary (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}).

\item {\bf Antenna2} --- The second antenna in a baseline pair; for baseline 2-4, Antenna2 = 4. Antennae are numbered according to the antenna IDs listed in {\tt listobs} (\S~\ref{section:io.list}) or the {\tt plotms} data summary (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}).

\item {\bf Antenna} --- Antenna ID for plotting antenna-based quantities. Antennae are numbered according to the antenna IDs listed in {\tt listobs} (\S~\ref{section:io.list}) or the {\tt plotms} data summary (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}).

\item {\bf  Baseline} --- The baseline number.

\item {\bf UVDist} --- Projected baseline separations in units of meters. Note that {\bf UVDist} is {\it not} a function of frequency.

\item {\bf UVwave} --- Projected baseline separations in units of the observing wavelength (lambda, not kilolambda). {\bf UVDist\_L} {\it is} a function of frequency, and therefore, there will be a different data point for each frequency channel.

\item {\bf U}, {\bf V}, and {\bf W} --- {\it u}, {\it v}, and {\it w}
  in units of meters.

\item {\bf Uwave}, {\bf Vwave}, and {\bf Wwave} --- {\it u}, {\it v}, and {\it w}
  in units of wavelengths lambda.

\item {\bf Amp} --- Data amplitudes in units which are proportional to Jansky (for data which are fully calibrated, the units should be in Jy).

\item {\bf Phase} --- Data phases in units of degrees.

\item {\bf Real} and {\bf Imag} --- The real and imaginary parts of
  the visibility in units which are proportional to Jansky (for data
  which are fully calibrated, the units should be Jy).

\item {\bf Wt} and {\bf Wt*Amp} --- the weight of the visibility and
  the prodict of the weight and the amplitude


\item {\bf Flag} --- Data which are flagged have Flag = 1, whereas unflagged data are set to Flag = 0. Note that, to display flagged data, you will have to click on the {\bf Plots $>$ Display} tab and choose a {\bf Flagged Points Symbol} (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.symbol}).

\item {\bf Azimuth} and {\bf Ant-Azimuth} --- Azimuth in units of degrees. {\bf Azimuth} plots a fiducial value for the entire array, while {\bf Ant-Azimuth} plots the azimuth for each individual antenna (their azimuths will differ by small amounts, because each antenna is located at a slightly different longitude, latitude, and elevation).

\item {\bf Elevation} and {\bf Ant-Elevation} --- Elevation in units
  of degrees. {\bf Elevation} is a representative value for the entire
  array, while {\bf Ant-Elevation} is the elevation for each
  individual antenna (their elevations will differ by small amounts,
  because each antenna is located at a slightly different longitude,
  latitude, and elevation).

\item {\bf HourAngle} --- Hour angle in units of hours. This is a fiducial value for the entire array.
%Beta Alert: Some day soon, Ant-HourAngle will be added.

\item {\bf ParAngle} and {\bf Ant-ParAng} --- Parallactic angle in
  units of degrees. {\bf ParAngle} is the fiducial parallactic angle
  for all antennae in the array, while {\bf Ant-ParAng} plots the
  parallactic ange for each individual antenna (their parallactic
  angles will differ by small amounts, because each antenna is located
  at a slightly different longitude, latitude, and elevation).

\item {\bf Row} --- Data row number. A row number corresponds to a
  unique time, baseline, and spectral window in the measurement set.

\item {\bf FlagRow} --- In some tasks, if a whole data row is flagged,
  then FlagRow will be set to 1 for that row. Unflagged rows have
  FlagRow = 0. However, note that some tasks (like {\tt plotms}) may
  flag a row, but {\it not} set FlagRow = 1. It is probably better to
  plot Flag than FlagRow for most applications.

\item {\bf GainAmp}, {\bf GainPhase}, {\bf GainReal}, {\bf GainImag} ---
  are the amplitude, phase, real and imaginary part of the calibration
  tables for regular complex gain tables. 

\item {\bf Delay} --- The delay of a delay calibration table

\item {\bf Opac} --- Opacity values of a Opacity calibration table

\item {\bf SwPower} --- Switched Power values for VLA switched power
  calibration tables

\item {\bf Tsys} --- Tsys for ALMA Tsys calibration tables

\end{itemize}

If the data axis selected from the drop-down menu is already stored in
the cache (therefore implying that plotting will proceed relatively
quickly), an ``X'' will appear in the checkbox next to {\bf In
  Cache?}. If the data shall be reloaded from disk, the ``force
reload'' checkmark should be set at the bottom of this display. 



For relevant data axes like {\bf Amp} and {\bf Phase}, the user will
be presented with the option to plot raw data or calibrated data. This
can be selected via a drop-down menu called {\bf Data Column}, located
directly under the drop-down menu for X or Y Axis selection (see the Y
axis in Figure \ref{fig:plotms_axes}). To plot raw data, select
``data''; to plot calibrated data, select ``corrected''. Note that
this choice will only have an impact on a plot if a calibration table
has been applied to the measurement set (see {\tt applycal},
Sect.\,\ref{section:cal.correct.apply}).

If a data model has been applied to the measurement set (e.g., with
{\tt setjy}, Sect.\,\ref{section:cal.prior.models}) it can be plotted
by selecting ``model'' from the {\bf Data Column} menu. Finally, to
plot the differences between the calibrated data and the model, select
``corrected-model'' and for uncalibrated data/model differences
``data-model'' from {\bf Data Column}.

\subsubsection{Tools}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.tools}

Various tools---selectable as icon buttons at the bottom of the {\tt plotms} window---can be used to zoom, edit, and locate data. The icon buttons can be seen at the bottom of Figures \ref{fig:plotms_empty} and \ref{fig:plotms_axes}, and are, from left to right:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Zoom} --- The ``magnifying glass'' button (1st on left) lets you draw a box around a region of the plot (left-click on one corner of the box, and drag the mouse to the opposite corner of the desired box), and then zooms in on this box.  

\item {\bf Pan} --- The ``four-arrow'' button (2nd from left) lets you pan around a zoomed plot.

\item {\bf Annotate} --- The 3rd button from the left is chosen from a
  drop-down menu to either {\bf Annotate Text} (``T with a green
  diamond'' button) or {\bf Annotate Rectangle} (``pencil''
  button). In the {\bf Annotate Text} environment, click on a location
  in the plot where text is desired; a window will pop up, allowing
  you to type text in it. When you click the {\bf OK} button, this
  text will appear on the plot. {\bf Annotate Rectangle} simply lets
  you draw a box on the plot by left-clicking and dragging the
  mouse. By clicking on the {\bf Annotator} tab near the top of the
  {\tt plotms} window, different fonts, colors, line styles, etc. can
  be selected for annotations.

\item {\bf Home} --- The ``house'' button (5th from left) returns to the original zoom level.

\item {\bf Stack Back} and {\bf Stack Forward} --- The left and right
  arrow buttons (4th and 6th from left) step through the zoom settings
  you've visited.

\item {\bf Mark Regions} --- The ``box with a green diamond'' button
  (7th from left) lets you mark a region for flagging, unflagging, or
  locating. Left-click on one corner of the desired region, and then
  drag the mouse to set the opposite corner of the region. You can
  mark multiple boxes before performing an operation on them.

\item {\bf Clear Regions} --- Clicking on the ``box with a red
  circle'' button (8th from left) will clear {\it all} regions which
  have been marked using {\bf Mark Regions}.

\item {\bf Flag} --- Click on the ``flag'' button (9th from left) to flag all points in the marked regions.

\item {\bf Unflag} --- Click on the ``crossed-out flag'' button (10th
  from left) to unflag any flagged points that would be in the marked
  regions (even if invisible).

\item {\bf Locate} --- The ``magnifying glass on a sheet of paper''
  button (11th from left) will print out information to the command
  line about points in the marked regions.

\item {\bf Hold Drawing} --- If the ``hold drawing'' button
  (rightmost, or 12th from left) is depressed, and if new plot axes
  are selected from the {\bf Plots $>$ Axes} tab, these new data will
  be cached but not plotted. When the button is clicked on again and
  un-depressed, it will automatically plot the data that was last
  requested. This can be particularly useful when changing the size of
  the {\bf plotms} window.
\end{itemize}

There are two relevant options under the {\bf Options} tab near the
top of the {\tt plotms} window. The {\bf when changing plot axes,
  clear any existing regions or annotations} checkbox determines when
regions and annotation are deleted from the plot. The {\bf Tool Button
  Style} drop-drop down menu determines if icons and/or text represent
the buttons at the bottom of the {\tt plotms} window.

It is possible to hide these icons by going to the {\bf View $>$
  Toolbars} menu at the top of the {\tt plotms} window and
un-depressing the {\bf Tools} option (except for {\bf Hide Drawing},
which is hidden by clicking on {\bf View $>$ Toolbars $>$
  Display}). In addition, the above tools can also be accessed by
clicking on the {\bf Tools} tab near the top of the {\tt plotms}
window (just below the {\bf View} menu).

The {\bf Tools} tab also enables one additional tool, the {\bf
  Tracker}. To use {\bf Tracker}, click on the {\bf Hover} and/or {\bf

  Display} checkbox, and place your mouse over the plot. {\bf Tracker}
will output the X and Y position of your mouse, either as text
superimposed on the plot near your mouse (if {\bf Hover} is selected)
or in the blank window in the {\bf Tools} tab (if {\bf Display} is
selected). Pressing the {\tt SPACE} bar will copy the lines into the
larger white box below to the right. This can be repeated many times
and a log of positions and values will be created. The content in the
box can then be easily copied and pasted into any other application
that is used for data analysis. The {\bf Clear} button wipes out the
content of the box for a fresh start into new scientific adventures.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Interactive Flagging in {\tt plotms}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.flag}

Interactive flagging, on the principle of ``see it --- flag it'', is possible on the X-Y display of the data plotted by {\tt plotms}.  The user can
use the cursor to mark one or more regions, and then flag, unflag, or list the data that falls in these zones of the display.

Using the row of icons buttons at the bottom of the {\tt plotms} window (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.tools}), click on the {\bf Mark Regions} button (which will appear to depress), then mark a region by left-clicking and dragging the mouse (each click and drag will mark an additional region).  You can get rid of all your regions by clicking on the {\bf Clear Regions}. Once regions are marked, you can then click on one of the other buttons to take action:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Flag} --- flag the points in the region(s),
\item {\bf Unflag} --- unflag flagged points in the region(s),
\item {\bf Locate} --- spew out a list of the points in the region(s) to the command line (Warning: this could be a long list!).
\end{enumerate}
Figure \ref{fig:markflags} shows an example of marking regions and then clicking the {\bf Flag} button. Whenever you click on a button, that action occurs without requiring an explicit disk-write.  If you quit {\tt plotms} and re-enter, you will see your previous edits.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\pngname{plotms_reg_noflag}{3}
\pngname{plotms_reg_flag}{3}
\caption{\label{fig:markflags} Plot of amplitude versus time, before (left) and after (right) flagging two marked regions. To unflag these regions, mark the two same regions and click the {\bf Unflag} button.}
\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A table with the name {\tt <msname>.flagversions} (where {\tt vis=<msname>}) will be created in the same directory if it does not exist already. It is recommended that you save important flagging stages using the {\tt flagmanager} task (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagmanager}).

Flags can also be extended with options in the {\bf Flagging} tab, found near the top of the {\tt plotms} window. Flag extension enables the user to plot a subset of the data and extend the flagging to a wider set. In this release, the only functional extensions are over channel and correlation.

By checking the boxes next to {\bf Extend Flags} and {\bf Channel}, flagging will be extended to other channels in the same {\tt spw} as the displayed point.  For example, if {\tt spw='0:0'} and channel 0 is displayed, then flagging will extend to all channels in spw 0.

By checking the boxes next to {\bf Extend Flags} and {\bf Correlation}, flags will be extended beyond the correlations displayed. Currently the only option is to extend to {\bf All} correlations, implying that all correlations will be flagged, e.g.\ with RR displayed, the correlations RR, RL, LR, and LL will all be flagged. 

%Setting {\tt extendspw='all'} will extend the flagging to all other spw for the selection.  Using the same example as above, with {\tt spw='0:0'} displayed, then channel 0 in ALL spw will be flagged. Note that use of {\tt extendspw} could result in unintended behavior if the spw have different numbers of channels, or if it is used in conjunction with {\tt extendchan}.

{\bf WARNING:} use of flag extensions may lead to deletion of much more data than desired.  Be careful!

%Setting {\tt extendant='all'} will extend the flagging to all baselines that have antennas in common with those displayed and marked.  For example, if {\tt antenna='1\&2'} is shown, then ALL baselines to BOTH antennas 1 and 2 will be flagged.  Currently, there is no option to extend the flag to ONLY baselines to the first (or  second) antenna in a displayed pair, so it is better to use {\tt flagdata} to remove specific antennas.

%Setting {\tt extendtime='all'} will extend the flagging to all times matching the other selection or extension for the data in the marked region.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Averaging Data}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.average}

The {\bf Plots $>$ Data} tab enables averaging of the data in order to increase signal-to-noise of the plotted points or to increase plotting speed.The options for {\bf Averaging} ar e: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf channel}
   \item {\bf time}
   \item {\bf all baselines} or {\bf per antenna}
   \item {\bf all spectral windows}
   \item {\bf scalar}
\end{itemize}
The box next to a given {\bf Averaging} mode needs to be checked for
that averaging to take effect.

For example, to average {\it n} channels together, the user would
click on the box next to {\bf Channels} so that an ``X'' appears in
it, and then type the number {\it n} in the empty box. When the user
next clicks on {\bf Plot}, every {\it n} channels will then be
averaged together and the total number of channels plotted will be
decreased by a factor of {\it n}.

Time averaging is a little trickier, as it is controlled by three
fields. If the checkbox next to {\bf Time} under {\bf Averaging} is
clicked on, a blank box with units of seconds will become active,
along with two additional checkboxes: {\bf Scan} and {\bf Field}. If
averaging is desired over a relatively short interval (say, 30
seconds, shorter than the scan length), a number can simply be entered
into the blank box and, when the data are replotted, the data will be
time averaged. Clicking on the {\bf Scan} or {\bf Field} checkbox in
this case will have no impact on the time averaging.

These checkboxes become relevant if averaging over a relatively long
time---say the entire observation, which consists of multiple
scans---is desired. Regardless of how large a number is typed into the
{\bf Time} averaging blank box, only data within individual scans will
be averaged together. In order to average data across scan boundaries,
the {\bf Scan} checkbox must be clicked on and the data
replotted. Finally, clicking on the {\bf Field} checkbox enables the
averaging of multiple fields together in time.

Clicking on the {\bf All Baselines} checkbox will average all
baselines in the array together. Alternatively, the {\bf Per Antenna}
box may be checked, which will average all baselines for a given
antenna together. In this case, all baselines are represented twice;
baseline 3-24 will contribute to the averages for both antenna 3 and
antenna 24. This can produce some rather strange-looking plots if the
user also selects on antenna---say, if the user requests to plot only
antenna 0 and then averages {\bf Per Antenna}, In this case, an
average of all baselines including antenna 0 will be plotted, but each
individual baseline including antenna 0 will also be plotted (because
the presence of baselines 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, etc.~trigger {\bf Per
  Antenna} averaging to try and compute averages for antennae 1, 2, 3,
etc. Therefore, baseline 0-1 will contribute to the average for
antenna 0, but it will also singlehandedly {\it be} the average for
antenna 1.)

Spectral windows can be averaged together by checking the box next to
{\bf All Spectral Windows}. This will result in, for a given channel
{\it n}, all channels {\it n} from the individual spectral windows
being averaged together.

Finally, the default mode is vector averaging, where the complex
average is formed by averaging the real and imaginary parts of the
relevant visibilities.  If {\bf Scalar} is chosen, then the amplitude
of the average is formed by a scalar average of the individual
visibility amplitudes.

When averaging, {\tt plotms} will prefer unflagged data.  I.e., if an
averaging bin contains any unflagged data at all, only the average of
the unflagged will be shown.  For averaging bins that contain {\em
  only} unflagged data, the average of that unflagged data will be
shown.  When flagging on a plot of averaged data, the flags will be
applied to the unaveraged data in the MS.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Plot Symbols}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.symbol}

Plot symbols are selected in the {\bf Plots $>$ Display} tab. Most
fundamentally, the user can choose to plot unflagged data and/or
flagged data. By default, unflagged data is plotted (the circle next
to {\bf Default} is checked under {\bf Unflagged Points Symbol}), and
flagged data is not plotted (the circle next to {\bf None} is checked
under {\bf Flagged Points Symbol}. We note here that plotting flagged
data on an averaged plot is undertaken at the user's own risk, as the
distinction between flagged points and unflagged points becomes
blurred if data are averaged over a dimension that is partially
flagged. Take, for example, a plot of amplitude versus. time where all
channels are averaged together, but some channels have been flagged
due to RFI spikes. In creating the average, {\tt plotms} will skip
over the flagged channels and only use the unflagged ones. The
averaged points will be considered unflagged, and the flagged data
will not appear on the plot at all.

A selection of {\bf None} produces no data points, {\bf Default}
results in data points which are small circles (blue for unflagged
data and red for flagged data), and {\bf Custom} allows the user to
define a plot symbol. If {\bf Custom} plot symbols are chosen, the
user can determine the symbol size by typing a number in the blank box
next to {\bf px} or by clicking on the adjacent up or down
arrows. Symbol shape can be chosen from the drop-down menu to be
either ``circle'', ``square'', ``diamond'', or ``pixel'' (note than
``pixel'' only has one possible size). ``autoscaling'' attempts to
adjust the size of the points from dots to circles of different sizes,
depending on how many points are plotted. Symbol color can be chosen
by typing a hex color code in the blank box next to {\bf Fill:} (e.g.,
``ff00ff''), or by clicking on the {\bf ...}  button and selecting a
color from the pop-up GUI. The adjacent drop-down menu provides
options for how heavily the plot symbol is shaded with this color,
from heaviest to lightest: ``fill'', ``mesh1'', ``mesh2'', ``mesh3'',
and ``no fill''. Finally, the plot symbol can be outlined in black (if
{\bf Outline: Default} is checked) or not (if {\bf Outline: None} is
checked). Note that if ``no fill'' and {\bf Outline: None} are
selected, the plot symbols will be invisible.

Finally, unflagged data points can be given informative symbol colors
using the {\bf Colorize} parameter. By checking the box next to {\bf
  Colorize} and selecting a data dimension from the drop-down menu,
the data will be plotted with colors that vary along that
dimension. For example, if ``corr'' is chosen from the {\bf Colorize}
menu, ``RR'', ``LL'', ``RL'', and ``LR'' data will each be plotted
with a different color. Note that, currently, {\bf colorize} and
plotting flagged data appear to be incompatible; a plot can only
include one of these special features at a time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Summarizing Data}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.summary}

Information about the measurement set can be obtained from within {\tt plotms} by clicking on the {\bf Summary} button, found at the bottom of the {\bf Plots $>$ Data} tab window. If ``All'' is chosen from the pull-down menu next to {\bf Summary}, {\tt listobs}-style output about scans, correlator configurations, and antennae will be written to the command line from which {\tt plotms} was started. For more detail, click on the {\bf Verbose} checkbox. For a specific subset of the data, choose a selection from the pull-down menu like ``Antenna'' or ``Field''.
%[THIS SUBSECTION COULD USE MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL SELECTIONS MEAN.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Defining Frequency and Velocity}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.trans}

If the user plans to plot {\bf Frequency}, the reference frame must be defined. By default, the plotted frequency is simply that observed at the telescope. However, transformations can be made by choosing a {\bf Frame} from the drop-down menu in the {\bf Plots $>$ Trans} tab. Frequency reference frames can be chosen to be:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf LSRK} --- local standard of rest (kinematic)
\item {\bf LSRD} --- local standard of rest (dynamic)
\item {\bf BARY} --- barycentric
\item {\bf GEO} --- geocentric
\item {\bf TOPO} --- topocentric
\item {\bf GALACTO} --- galactocentric
\item {\bf LGROUP} --- Local Group
\item {\bf CMB} --- cosmic microwave background dipole
\end{itemize}

{\bf Velocity} is affected by the user's choice of {\bf Frame}, but it is also impacted by the choice of velocity definition and spectral line rest frequency. The velocity definition is chosen from the {\bf Velocity Defn} drop-down menu in the {\bf Plots $>$ Trans} tab, offering selections of {\bf Radio}, {\bf True}, or {\bf Optical}. 

For more information on frequency frames and spectral coordinate systems, see the paper by Greisen et al. (A\&A, 446, 747, 2006) \footnote{Also at \url{http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~egreisen/scs.ps}}.

Finally, the spectral line's rest frequency in units of MHz should be typed into the blank box next to {\bf Rest Freq} in the {\bf Plots $>$ Trans} tab. You can use the {\tt me.spectralline} tool method to turn transition names into frequencies 
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <16>: me.spectralline('HI')
  Out[17]: 
{'m0': {'unit': 'Hz', 'value': 1420405751.786},
 'refer': 'REST',
 'type': 'frequency'}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

For a list of known lines in the CASA {\tt measures} system, use the toolkit command {\tt me.linelist()}.  For example:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <21>: me.linelist()
  Out[21]: 'HI H186A H185A H184A H183A H182A H181A H180A H179A H178A H177A H176A H175A

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Shifting the Phase Center}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.phcen}

The plot's phase center can be shifted in the {\bf Plots $>$ Trans} tab. Enter the X and Y shifts in units of arcseconds in the blank boxes under {\bf Phase center shift}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Plot Ranges}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.range}

The X and Y ranges of the plot can be set in the {\bf Plots $>$ Axes} tab. By default, the circle next to {\bf Automatic} will be checked, and the ranges will be auto-scaled. To define the range, click on the circle below {\bf Automatic} and enter a minimum and maximum value in the blank boxes (as for the X Axis in Figure \ref{fig:plotms_axes}. Note that if identical values are placed in the blank boxes ({\tt xmin=xmax} and/or {\tt ymin=ymax}), then the values will be ignored and a best guess will be made to auto-range that axis.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Plot Labels}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.labels}

The plot and axes labels which are displayed in the plot window are
set in the {\bf Plots $>$ Canvas} tab. To change the plot title, under
{\bf Canvas Title}, click on the circle next to the blank box and
enter the desired text. 
%(note that this is independent of the plot's title in the {\bf Plot
%Selection} menu; see \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.window}). 
To change the X- and Y-axis labels, similarly click on the circles next to the blank boxes under {\bf Show X Axis} and {\bf Show Y Axis} and type the desired text in the blank box. To display these new labels, simply click the {\bf Plot} button.

The user can determine the locations of axis labels in the {\bf Plots $>$ Axes} tab. The X-axis label switches from the bottom to the top of the plot depending on what is selected for {\bf Attach to:}. Similarly for the Y-Axis, the user can choose to attach axis labels and tick marks to the {\bf Top} or {\bf Bottom} (note that the axis labels have been attached to the {\bf Bottom} and {\bf Right} in Figure \ref{fig:plotms_axes}.

Finally, axis labels can be removed all together by unchecking the boxes next to {\bf Show X Axis} and {\bf Show Y Axis} om the {\bf Plots $>$ Canvas} tab.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Grid Lines}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.grid}

A grid of lines can be superimposed on the plot using {\bf Grid Lines} in the {\bf Plots $>$ Canvas} tab. ``Major'' grid lines are drawn at the locations of major tick marks, while ``minor'' grid lines are drawn at minor tick marks.

Grid line colors, thicknesses, and styles are selected independently for the ``major'' and ``minor'' grid lines. Desired line thickness should be typed into the blank boxes just to the right of the {\bf Major} and {\bf Minor} labels. Colors are set  by clicking on the {\bf ...} buttons. The blank boxes to the left of the {\bf ...} buttons will then contain the hex codes for the selected colors (e.g., ``808080''). Line styles can also be selected from the drop-down menus to the right of {\bf ...} buttons.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Legend}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.legend}

A plot symbol legend can be added to the plot by clicking on the checkbox next to {\bf Legend} in the {\bf Plots $>$ Canvas} tab. However, given the current functionalities of {\tt plotms}, a symbol legend is of very limited use. This option will become more relevant when overplotting capabilities are included in {\tt plotms}.

%\subsubsection{New Plot Windows and Plot Selection}
%\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.window}
%
%A new plot window can be opened using the drop-down menu which is located directly below the upper row of tabs (hereafter called the {\bf Plot Selection} menu; it is labelled as ``Amp vs. Time'' and circled in red in Figure \ref{fig:plotms_select}). To open a new window, select ``New Single Plot'' from this menu, and then click on the {\bf Go} button which will appear after this selection. There will now be two plot windows, one on top of the other, as in Figure \ref{fig:plotms_select}. The new window will be initially blanks, and to plot in it, the measurement set must be re-loaded and re-selected upon(\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.select}; then click the {\bf Plot} button. 
%
%Both plot windows should now be listed in the {\bf Plot Selection} drop-down menu. To return to editing the original plot, select it from this menu and click the {\bf Edit} button which will appear on selection. The name of each plot in this drop-down menu can be changed using {\bf Plot Title} in the {\bf Plots $>$ Axes} tab. Click on the circle next to the blank box under {\bf Plot Title} and enter the desired text for the title. Note that this is, by default, the same as the plot title displayed in the plot window, but it is not required to be. The plot title in the plot window is determined by {\bf Canvas Title} in the {\bf Plots $>$ Canvas} tab (see \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.labels}).
%
%The plot windows can be completely cleared by choosing ``Clear Plotter'' from the {\bf Plot Selection} menu. Clicking the {\bf Go} button will not only clear the plots themselves, but will also clear the plot parameters, loaded data, and the cache. 
%
%The {\bf Plot Selection} menu also presents the user with a ``New Multi Plot'' option, but note that multi-plots are not functional in this release of CASA. Selecting ``New Multi Plot'' and clicking the {\bf Go} button will currently crash {\tt plotms}.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% NB (gmoellen, 11Oct26): The Cache tab is now suppressed in the gui
%\subsubsection{The Cache}
%\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.cache}
%
%Data dimensions which are loaded into the cache can be plotted relatively quickly. To see which data dimensions %are loaded in the {\tt plotms} cache, navigate to the {\bf Plots $>$ Cache} tab. The {\bf Meta-Information Axes} %are always loaded in the cache, and include data like {\bf Channels} and {\bf Time}. 
%
%The {\bf Loaded Axes} are cached data dimensions, and have probably been recently plotted. To remove one of %these axes from the cache, click on its name so that it is highlighted and then click the {\bf Release} button.
%
%Finally, the {\bf Available Axes} are those data dimensions which are currently not stored in the cache. To load %one of them to the cache, click on its name to highlight it and then click the {\bf Load} button.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{The Options Tab}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.options}

A few miscellaneous options are available in the {\bf Options} tab,
the last tab at the top of the {\tt plotms} window. 
 The {\bf Tool Button Style} drop-drop down menu determines if icons and/or text represent the buttons in the toolbar near the bottom of the {\tt plotms} window. 

The {\bf Log Events} drop down menu determines how verbose {\tt plotms} is in documenting its actions on the command line.

There is a checkbox that determines the persistence of regions and annotations on new plots, labelled {\bf When changing plot axes, clear any existing regions and annotations}.

A useful option is the {\bf fixed size for cached image}
checkbox. It determines how large the dots in the panel are with
respect to the screen resolution. The values influence how the data
is redrawn on the panel. When the {\bf Screen resolution} is selected,
the {\tt plotms} window can be resized without redrawing on
the canvas -- a considerable speedup for large data sets. The penalty is
that the dots of the data points are the size of a pixel on the
screen, which may be very small for high resolution monitors. 

Finally, the {\bf File chooser history limit} determines the number of
remembered directories in the file loading pop-up of the {\bf Browse}
selection of the {\bf Data} tab.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Iteration}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.iter}

In many cases, it is desirable to iterate through the data that were
selected in the {\it Data} tab. A typical example is to display a
single baseline in a time vs. amplitude plot and then proceed to the
next baselines step by step. This can be done via the {\it Iter} tab
on the left hand side of {\tt plotms}. A drop-down menu allows you to
select the parameter to be iterated on, such as baseline or spw (press
{\it plot} after changing your selection). The plot titles in the main
panel in {\tt plotms} show which data slice is currently displayed. To
proceed to the next plot use the {\it green buttons} below the main
panel. The different button symbols let you to proceed panel by panel
or to jump to the first or last panel directly.
 

There are two scaling options for the axes: {\it Global} and {\it
  Self}. {\it Global} will use a common axis range based on data
loaded with the selection criteria specified in the {\it Data}
tab. {\it Self} readjusts the axes scaling to the data for each
individual panel of the iteration. 

Below, one can invoke multiple panels per display by selecting the
number of rows and columns to be displayed on the canvas.


Note that exporting iterated data only refers to the shown panel, the
exported files do not (yet) collate all the iteration panels in say a
multi-page pdf. So please export every panel separately.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Saving your plot}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.save}

You can save a copy of a plot to file in the {\bf Plots $>$ Export}
tab. Click the {\bf Browse} button for a GUI-based selection of the
directory and file name to which the plot will be saved. The file
format can also be determined in this GUI by the suffix given to the
filename: {\tt .png} (PNG), {\tt .jpg} (JPG), {\tt .ps} (PS), {\tt
  .pdf} (PDF), and {\tt txt} (TEXT). Alternatively, the file format can
be selected from the {\bf Format} drop-down menu located just below
the {\bf Browse} button. In this case, {\tt plotms} will add a suffix
to the file name depending on the format chosen.

{\bf ALERT:} The plot files produced by the PS and PDF options can be
large and time-consuming to export.  The JPG is the smallest.\\


The exported plot resolution can be manipulated using the {\bf High
  Resolution}, {\bf DPI}, and {\bf Size} options.

Click on {\bf Export} to create the file. Note that, if there is more
than one plot displayed in the {\tt plotms} window,
% (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms.window}), 
it will only export the currently selected plot.

the {\tt TEXT} format will not save an image but the data points
themselves. This allows one to dump the current plot into a file that
is used in other programs for further processing. The reported data is
the same as when using the {\tt locate} button in {\tt plotms} and the
format looks like:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
# x y chan scan field ant1 ant2 ant1name ant2name time freq spw corr offset currchunk irel
# Real Imag None None None None None None None MJD(seconds) GHz None None None None None
0.282938 0.0387583 31 5 2 1 12 ea02@E02 ea21@E01 4778968956.000 36.308479452 1 RR 26 0 26

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

where x and y are the two plotted axes and the other columns contain
additional information such as the baselines or frequencies. The three
last columns {\it offset, corrchunk, and irel} are internal data
management items for {\tt plotms} and you most likely will never use them. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Exiting {\tt plotms}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotms.exit}

To exit the {\tt plotms} GUI, select {\bf Quit} from the {\bf File} menu at the top of the {\tt plotms} window. You can also dismiss the window by killing it with the ``X'' on the frame.

Alternatively, you can just leave it alone, and {\bf plotms} will keep
running in the background. If the data file changes in the background,
you can force reloading the data via the 'force reload' checkbox
next to the 'Plot' button. Alternatively, press SHIFT while clicking
on 'Plot' for the same purpose.

\subsection{Plotting and Editing using {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy}


\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{2.5in}
  \begin{boxedminipage}{2.5in}
     \centerline{\bf Inside the Toolkit:}
     Access to {\tt matplotlib} is also provided through 
     the {\tt pl} tool. 
     See below for a description of the {\tt pl} tool functions. 
  \end{boxedminipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

\vspace{5cm}

{\bf ALERT:} The {\tt plotxy} code is fragile and slow, and is being replaced by the {\tt plotms} (\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotms}). We retain {\tt plotxy} in this release as not all functionality is available yet in {\tt plotms}.

%\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{2.5in}

{\tt Plotxy} is a tool for visualizing and editing visibility
data. Unlike {\tt plotms}, it is useful in scripting, as it can
non-interactively produce a hardcopy plot (see
\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.print}). It also has multi-plot
(\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.subplot}), iteration
(\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.iter}), and overplotting
(\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.overplot}) functionality---unlike
{\tt plotms} in the current release. {\tt Plotxy} uses the {\tt
  matplotlib} plotting library to display its plots. You can find
information on {\tt matplotlib} at
\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}.







\begin{figure}[h!]

\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To bring up this plotter use the {\tt plotxy} task.  The inputs are: 
\small
\begin{verbatim}

async            =      False   #  If true the taskname must be started using plotxy(...)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\bf ALERT:} The {\tt plotxy} task expects all of the scratch columns to
be present in the MS, even if it is not asked to plot the contents.
If you get an error to the effect {\tt "Invalid Table operation:
Table: cannot add a column"} then use {\tt clearcal()} to force these
columns to be made in the MS.  Note that this will clear anything in
all scratch columns (in case some were actually there and being used).

Setting {\tt selectdata=True} opens up the selection sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
selectdata       =       True   #   Other data selection parameters
     antenna     =         ''   #   antenna/baselines: ''==>all, antenna = '3,VA04' 
     timerange   =         ''   #   time range: ''==>all 
     correlation =         ''   #   correlations: default = '' 
     scan        =         ''   #   scan numbers: Not yet implemented
     feed        =         ''   #   multi-feed numbers: Not yet implemented
     array       =         ''   #   array numbers: Not yet implemented
     uvrange     =         ''   #   uv range''==>all; uvrange = '0~100kl' (default unit=meters)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
These are described in \S~\ref{section:io.selection}.

Averaging is controlled with the set of parameters
\small
\begin{verbatim}
averagemode      =   'vector'   #  Select averaging type: vector, scalar
     timebin     =        '0'   #  Length of time-interval in seconds to average
     crossscans  =      False   #  Have time averaging cross scan boundaries?
     crossbls    =      False   #  have averaging cross over baselines?
     crossarrays =      False   #  have averaging cross over arrays?
     stackspw    =      False   #  stack multiple spw on top of each other?
     width       =        '1'   #  Number of channels to average
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
See \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.average} below for more on averaging.

You can extend the flagging beyond the data cell plotted:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
extendflag          =   True    #  Have flagging extend to other data points?
     extendcorr     =     ''    #  flagging correlation extension type
     extendchan     =     ''    #  flagging channel extension type
     extendspw      =     ''    #  flagging spectral window extension type
     extendant      =     ''    #  flagging antenna extension type
     extendtime     =     ''    #  flagging time extension type
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
See \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.extend} below for more on flag
extension.

The {\tt restfreq} parameter can be set to a transition or frequency:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
restfreq            =    'HI'   #  a frequency quanta or transition name. see help for options
     frame          =  'LSRK'   #  frequency frame for spectral axis. see help for options
     doppler        = 'RADIO'   #  doppler mode. see help for options
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
See \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.restfreq} below for more on setting rest
frequencies and frames.

Setting {\tt selectplot=True} will open up a set of plotting control
sub-parameters.  
These are described in \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.select} below.

The {\tt interactive} and {\tt figfile} parameters allow
non-interactive production of hardcopy plots.  See
\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.print} for more details on saving plots to disk.

The {\tt iteration}, {\tt overplot}, {\tt plotrange}, 
{\tt plotsymbol}, {\tt showflags} and {\tt subplot}
parameters deserve extra explanation, and are described below.

For example:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
plotxy(vis='jupiter6cm.ms',                # jupiter 6cm dataset
       xaxis='uvdist',                     # plot uv-distance on x-axis
       yaxis='amp',                        # plot amplitude on y-axis
       field='JUPITER',                    # plot only JUPITER
       selectdata=True,                    # open data selection
       correlation='RR,LL',                #   plot RR and LL correlations
       selectplot=True,                    # open plot controls
       title = 'Jupiter 6cm uncalibrated') #   give it a title 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The plotter resulting from these settings is shown in figure \ref{fig:matplotlib}.  

{\bf ALERT:} The {\tt plotxy} task still has a number of issues.
The averaging has been greatly speeded up in this release, but there
are cases where the plots will be made incorrectly.  In particular,
there are problems plotting multiple {\tt spw} at the same time.
There are sometimes also cases where data that you have flagged in 
{\tt plotxy} from averaged data is done so incorrectly.  This task is
under active development for the next cycle to fix these remaining 
problems, so users should be aware of this.

{\bf ALERT:} Another know problem with ({\tt plotxy}) is that it
fails if the path to your working directory contains spaces in
its name, e.g. {\tt /users/smyers/MyTest/} is fine, but 
{\tt /users/smyers/My\ Test/} is not!

% There are a number of things to keep in mind and to be aware of
% in order to make your plotting and editing go smoother:

% The {\tt field} selection is a minimum match on a
% space-separated list of names. You can use the {\tt
% selectfield(vis=filename, minstring='string')} to test what field
% names and indices you are matching. Similarly, {\tt
% selectantenna(vis=filename, minstring='antname')} will also give you
% this information for antenna names.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{GUI Plot Control}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.control}

You can use the various buttons on the {\tt plotxy} GUI to control
its operation -- in particular, to determine flagging and unflagging
behaviors.

There is a standard row of buttons at the bottom.  These include
(left to right):
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Home} --- The ``house'' button (1st on left) returns to
  the original zoom level.
\item {\bf Step} --- The left and right arrow buttons (2nd and 3rd
  from left) step through the zoom settings you've visited.
\item {\bf Pan} --- The ``four-arrow button'' (4th from left) lets you pan
  in zoomed plot.
\item {\bf Zoom} --- The most useful is the ``magnifying glass'' (5th
  from the left) which lets you draw a box and zoom in on the plot.  
\item {\bf Panels} --- The ``window-thingy'' button (second from
  right) brings up a menu to adjust the panel placement in the plot.
\item {\bf Save} -- The ``disk'' button (last on right) saves a
  {\tt .png} copy of the plot to a generically named file on disk.
\end{itemize}

In a row above these, there are a set of other buttons (left to right):
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Mark Region} --- If depressed lets you draw rectangles to
  mark points in the panels.  This is done by left-clicking and
  dragging the mouse.  You can Mark multiple boxes before doing
  something.  Clicking the button again will un-depress it and forget
  the regions.  ESC will remove the last region marked.
\item {\bf Flag} --- Click this to Flag the points in a marked region.
\item {\bf Unflag} --- Click this to Unflag any flagged point that
  would be in that region (even if invisible).
\item {\bf Locate} --- Print out some information to the logger on
  points in the marked regions.  
\item {\bf Next} --- Step to the next plot in an iteration.
\item {\bf Quit} --- Exit {\tt plotcal}, clear the window and detach from the MS.
\end{itemize}

These buttons are shared with the {\tt plotcal} tool.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{The {\tt selectplot} Parameters}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.select}

These parameters work in concert with the native matplotlib
functionality to enable flexible representations of data displays. 

Setting {\tt selectplot=True} will open up a set of plotting control
sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
selectplot       =       True   #  Select additional plotting options (e.g, fontsize, title,etc)
     markersize  =        5.0   #  Size of plotted marks
     linewidth   =        1.0   #  Width of plotted lines
     skipnrows   =          1   #  Plot every nth point
     newplot     =      False   #  Replace the last plot or not when overplotting
     clearpanel  =     'Auto'   #  Specify if old plots are cleared or not
     title       =         ''   #  Plot title (above plot)
     xlabels     =         ''   #  Label for x-axis
     ylabels     =         ''   #  Label for y-axis
     fontsize    =       10.0   #  Font size for labels
     windowsize  =        5.0   #  Window size: not yet implemented
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{2.5in}
  \begin{boxedminipage}{2.5in}
     \centerline{\bf Inside the Toolkit:}
        For even more functionality, you can access the 
        {\tt pl} tool directly using Pylab functions that 
        allow one to annotate, alter, or add
        to any plot displayed in the {\tt matplotlib} plotter 
        (e.g. {\tt plotxy}).
  \end{boxedminipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

The {\tt markersize} parameter will change the size of the plot
symbols.  Increasing it will help legibility when doing screen shots.
Decreasing it can help in congested plots.  The {\tt linewidth}
parameter will do similar things to the lines.

The {\tt skipnrows} parameter, if set to an integer {\tt n} greater than 1,
will allow only every {\tt n}th point to be plotted.  It does this,
as the name suggests, by skipping over whole rows of the MS, so beware
(channels are all within the same row for a given {\tt spw}).  Be
careful flagging on data where you have skipped points!  Note
that you can also reduce the number of points plotted via averaging
(\S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.average}) or channel striding in the 
{\tt spw} specification (\S~\ref{section:io.selection.spw}).

The {\tt newplot} toggle lets you choose whether or not the
last layer plotted is replaced when {\tt overplot=True}, or whether
a new layer is added.

The {\tt clearpanel} parameter turns on/off the clearing of plot panels
that lie under the current panel layer being plotted. The options are:
{\tt 'none'} (clear nothing), {\tt 'auto'} (automatically clear the
plotting area), {\tt 'current'} (clear the current plot area only), 
and {\tt 'all'} (clear the whole plot panel).

The {\tt title}, {\tt xlabels}, and {\tt ylabels} parameters can
be used to change the plot title and axes labels.

The {\tt fontsize} parameter is useful in order to enlarge the label
fonts so as to be visible when making plots for screen capture, or
just to improve legibility.  Shrinking can help if you have lots of
panels on the plot also.

The {\tt windowsize} parameter is supposed to allow adjustments on
the window size. {\bf ALERT:} This currently does nothing,
unless you set it below 1.0, in which case it will produce an 
error.

%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ The {\tt iteration} parameter}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.iter}

There are currently four iteration options available:
{\tt 'field'}, {\tt 'antenna'}, and {\tt 'baseline'}.  
If one of these options
is chosen, the data will be split into separate plot displays for each
value of the iteration axis (e.g., for the VLA, the 'antenna' option
will get you 27 displays, one for each antenna).  

An example use of iteration:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
  # choose channel averaging, every 5 channels
  plotxy('n5921.ms','channel',subplot=221,iteration='antenna',width='5')
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The results of this are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plotiter}.  Note
that this example combines the use of {\tt width}, {\tt iteration}
and {\tt subplot}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\pngname{plotxy_iter}{6}
\caption{\label{fig:plotiter} The {\tt plotxy} iteration plot.
  The first set of plots from the example in
  \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.iter} with {\tt iteration='antenna'}.
  Each time you press the {\bf Next} button, you
  get the next series of plots.} 
\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}

{\bf NOTE:} If you use {\tt iteration='antenna'} or {\tt 'baseline'},
be aware if you have set {\tt antenna} selection.  You can also
control whether you see auto-correlations or not using the appropriate
syntax, e.g. {\tt antenna='*\&\&*'} or {\tt antenna='*\&\&\&'}
(\S~\ref{section:io.selection.selectdata.antenna}).

%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ The {\tt overplot} parameter}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.overplot}

The {\tt overplot} parameter toggles whether the current plot will
be overlaid on the previous plot or subpanel (via the {\tt subplot}
setting, \S~{section:edit.plot.plotxy.subplot}) or will overwrite it.
The default is {\tt False} and the new plot will replace the old.

The {\tt overplot} parameter interacts with the {\tt newplot}
sub-parameter (see \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.select}).

See \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.showflags} for an example using 
{\tt overplot}. 

%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ The {\tt plotrange} parameter}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.plotrange}

The {\tt plotrange} parameter can be used to specify the size of the
plot.  The format is {\tt [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]}.  The units are
those on the plot.  For example,
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   plotrange = [-20,100,15,30]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Note that if {\tt xmin=xmax} and/or {\tt ymin=ymax}, then the values
will be ignored and a best guess will be made to auto-range that axis.



Unfortunately, the units for the time axis must be in Julian
seconds. This is somewhat inconvenient as the usual time parameter is
given in Julian days. To calculate the Julian seconds the {\tt
  me.epoch} tool can be used. An example:
For 02:00 UT on 2012/05/22, the value of MJD seconds can be calculated
via 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
86400*(me.epoch('utc','2012/05/22')['m0']['value']+2/24.) 
\end{verbatim}
which results in {\tt 4844368800.0}.

\subsubsection{ The {\tt plotsymbol} parameter}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.symb}

The {\tt plotsymbol} parameter defines both the line or
symbol for the data being drawn as well as the color; from the
matplotlib online documentation (e.g., type {\tt pl.plot?} for help):

\small
\begin{verbatim}
    The following line styles are supported:
        -     : solid line
        --    : dashed line
        -.    : dash-dot line
        :     : dotted line
        .     : points
        ,     : pixels
        o     : circle symbols
        ^     : triangle up symbols
        v     : triangle down symbols
        <     : triangle left symbols
        >     : triangle right symbols
        s     : square symbols
        +     : plus symbols
        x     : cross symbols
        D     : diamond symbols
        d     : thin diamond symbols
        1     : tripod down symbols
        2     : tripod up symbols
        3     : tripod left symbols
        4     : tripod right symbols
        h     : hexagon symbols
        H     : rotated hexagon symbols
        p     : pentagon symbols
        |     : vertical line symbols
        _     : horizontal line symbols
        steps : use gnuplot style 'steps' # kwarg only
    The following color abbreviations are supported
        b  : blue
        g  : green
        r  : red
        c  : cyan
        m  : magenta
        y  : yellow
        k  : black
        w  : white
    In addition, you can specify colors in many weird and
    wonderful ways, including full names 'green', hex strings
    '#008000', RGB or RGBA tuples (0,1,0,1) or grayscale
    intensities as a string '0.8'.
    Line styles and colors are combined in a single format string, as in
    'bo' for blue circles.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ The {\tt showflags} parameter}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.showflags}

The {\tt showflags} parameter determines whether {\em only} unflagged
data ({\tt showflags=False}) or flagged ({\tt showflags=True}) data is
plotted by this execution.  The default is {\tt False} and will show
only unflagged ``good'' data.

Note that if you want to plot both unflagged and flagged data, in
different colors, then you need to run {\tt plotxy} twice using
{\tt overplot} (see \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.overplot}) 
the second time, e.g.
\small
\begin{verbatim}
> plotxy(vis="myfile", xaxis='uvdist', yaxis='amp' )
> plotxy(vis="myfile", xaxis='uvdist', yaxis='amp', overplot=True, showflags=True )
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

%%%%%%
\subsubsection{ The {\tt subplot} parameter }
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.subplot}

The {\tt subplot} parameter takes three
numbers. The first is the number of y panels (stacking vertically),
the second is the number of xpanels (stacking horizontally) and the
third is the number of the panel you want to draw into. For example,
{\tt subplot=212} would draw into the lower of two
panels stacked vertically in the figure.

An example use of subplot capability is shown in
Fig~\ref{fig:multiplot}.  These were drawn with the commands (for the
top, bottom left, and bottom right panels respectively):
\small
\begin{verbatim}
plotxy('n5921.ms','channel',     # plot channels for the n5921.ms data set
       field='0',                  # plot only first field
       datacolumn='corrected',     # plot corrected data
       plotcolor='',               # over-ride default plot color
       plotsymbol='go',            # use green circles
       subplot=211)                # plot to the top of two panels

plotxy('n5921.ms','x',           # plot antennas for n5921.ms data set
       field='0',                  # plot only first field
       datacolumn='corrected',     # plot corrected data
       subplot=223,                # plot to 3rd panel (lower left) in 2x2 grid
       plotcolor='',               # over-ride default plot color
       plotsymbol='r.')            # red dots

plotxy('n5921.ms','u','v',       # plot uv-coverage for n5921.ms data set
       field='0',                  # plot only first field
       datacolumn='corrected',     # plot corrected data
       subplot=224,                # plot to the lower right in a 2x2 grid
       plotcolor='',               # over-ride default plot color
       plotsymbol='b,')            # blue, somewhat larger dots
                                   # NOTE: You can change the gridding
                                   # and panel size by manipulating
                                   # the ny x nx grid.

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\begin{figure}[h!]

\pngname{ngc5921_multiplot}{5.5}
\caption{\label{fig:multiplot} Multi-panel display of visibility

See also \S~\ref{section:edit.plot.plotxy.iter} above, and
Figure~\ref{fig:plotiter} for an example of channel 
averaging using {\tt iteration} and {\tt subplot}.
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Averaging in {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.average}

The averaging parameters and sub-parameters are:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
averagemode      = 'vector' #  Select averaging type: vector, scalar
     timebin     =      '0' #  length of time in seconds to average, default='0', or: 'all'
     crossscans  =    False #  have time averaging cross over scans?
     crossbls    =    False #  have averaging cross over baselines?
     crossarrays =    False #  have averaging cross over arrays?
     stackspw    =    False #  stack multiple spw on top of each other?
     width       =      '1' #  number of channels to average, default: '1', or: 'all', 'allspw'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The choice of {\tt averagemode} controls how the amplitudes are calculated
in the average.  The default mode is {\tt 'vector'}, where the complex
average is formed by averaging the real and imaginary parts of the
relevant visibilities.  If {\tt 'scalar'} is chosen, then the
amplitude of the average is formed by a scalar average of the
individual visibility amplitudes.

Time averaging is effected by setting the {\tt timebin} parameter to a
value larger than the integration time.  Currently, {\tt timebin}
takes a string containing the averaging time in seconds, e.g.
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   timebin = '60.0'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
to plot one-minute averages.

Channel averaging is invoked by setting {\tt width} to a value greater
than 1.  Currently, the averaging {\tt width} is given as a number of
channels.

By default, the averaging will not cross {\tt scan} boundaries (as set
in the import process).  However, if {\tt crossscans=True}, then
averaging will cross scans.  

Note that data taken in different sub-arrays are never averaged
together. Likewise, there is no way to plot data averaged over {\tt field}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Interactive Flagging in {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.flag}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{2.5in}
  \begin{boxedminipage}{2.5in}
     \centerline{\bf Hint!}
     In the plotting environments such as {\tt plotxy}, the
     {\tt ESC} key can be used to remove the last region box
     drawn. 
  \end{boxedminipage}
\end{wrapfigure}

Interactive flagging, on the principle of ``see it --- flag it'', is
possible on the X-Y display of the data plotted by {\tt plotxy}.  The user can
use the cursor to mark one or more regions, and then flag, unflag, or list
the data that falls in these zones of the display.

There is a row of buttons below the plot in the window.  You can punch the
{\bf Mark Region} button (which will appear to depress), then mark a region
by left-clicking and dragging the mouse (each click and drag will mark an
additional region).  You can get rid of all your regions by clicking again
on the {\bf Mark Region} button (which will appear to un-depress), or you
can use the {\tt ESC} key to remove the last box you drew.  Once regions are
marked, you can then click on one of the other buttons to take action:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Flag} --- flag the points in the region(s),
\item {\bf Unflag} --- unflag flagged points in the region(s),
\item {\bf Locate} --- spew out a list of the points in the region(s) to 
   the logger (Warning: this could be a long list!).
\end{enumerate}
Whenever you click on a button, that action occurs without 
forcing a disk-write (unlike previous versions).  If you quit {\tt plotxy}
and re-enter, you will see your previous edits.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\pngname{ngc5921_markflag2}{2.75}
\pngname{ngc5921_markflag3}{2.75}
\caption{\label{fig:markflags.plotxy} Plot of amplitude versus
uv distance, before (left) and after (right) flagging two marked regions.
The call was:
{\tt plotxy(vis='ngc5921.ms',xaxis='uvdist', field='1445*')}.
}
\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A table with the name {\tt <msname>.flagversions} (where
{\tt vis=<msname>}) will be created in the same directory if
it does not exist already.

It is recommended that you save important flagging stages using
the {\tt flagmanager} task (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagmanager}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Flag extension in {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.extend}

Flag extension is controlled using {\tt extendflag=T} and its sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
extendflag          =   True    #  Have flagging extend to other data points?
     extendcorr     =     ''    #  flagging correlation extension type
     extendchan     =     ''    #  flagging channel extension type
     extendspw      =     ''    #  flagging spectral window extension type
     extendant      =     ''    #  flagging antenna extension type
     extendtime     =     ''    #  flagging time extension type
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
The use of {\tt extendflag} enables the user to plot a subset of the
data and extend the flagging to a wider set.

{\bf ALERT:} Using the {\tt extendflag} options will greatly
slow down the flagging in {\tt plotxy}.  You will see a long delay
after hitting the {\bf Flag} button, with lots of logger messages
as it goes through each flag.  Fixing this requires a refactoring
of {\tt plotxy} which is underway starting in Patch 4 development.

Setting {\tt extendchan='all'} will extend the flagging to other
channels in the same {\tt spw} as the displayed point.  For example,
if {\tt spw='0:0'} and channel 0 is displayed, then flagging will
extend to all channels in spw 0.

The {\tt extendcorr} sub-parameter will extend the flagging beyond the
correlations displayed.  If {\tt extendcorr='all'}, then all
correlations will be flagged, e.g.\ with RR displayed RR,RL,LR,LL will 
be flagged.  If {\tt extendcorr='half'}, then the extension will be
to those correlations in common with that show, e.g.\ with RR
displayed then RR,RL,LR will be flagged.

Setting {\tt extendspw='all'} will extend the flagging to all other
spw for the selection.  Using the same example as above, with
{\tt spw='0:0'} displayed, then channel 0 in ALL spw will be flagged.
Note that use of {\tt extendspw} could result in unintended behavior
if the spw have different numbers of channels, or if it is used in
conjunction with {\tt extendchan}.

{\bf WARNING:} use of the following options, particularly in
conjunction with other flag extensions, may lead to deletion of much
more data than desired.  Be careful!

Setting {\tt extendant='all'} will extend the flagging to all
baselines that have antennas in common with those displayed and
marked.  For example, if {\tt antenna='1\&2'} is shown, then ALL
baselines to BOTH antennas 1 and 2 will be flagged.  Currently, there
is no option to extend the flag to ONLY baselines to the first (or 
second) antenna in a displayed pair.

Setting {\tt extendtime='all'} will extend the flagging to all times 
matching the other selection or extension for the data in the marked
region.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Setting rest frequencies in {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.restfreq}

The {\tt restfreq} parameter can be set to a transition or frequency
and expands to allow setting of frame information.  For example,
\small
\begin{verbatim}
restfreq            =    'HI'   #  a frequency quanta or transition name. see help for options
     frame          =  'LSRK'   #  frequency frame for spectral axis. see help for options
     doppler        = 'RADIO'   #  doppler mode. see help for options
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
Examples of transitions include:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   restfreq='1420405751.786Hz'  #  21cm HI frequency
   restfreq='HI'                #  21cm HI transition name
   restfreq='115.2712GHz'       #  CO 1-0 line frequency
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
For a list of known lines in the CASA {\tt measures} system, use the
toolkit command {\tt me.linelist()}.  For example:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <14>: me.linelist()
  Out[14]: 'C109A CI CII166A DI H107A H110A H138B H166A H240A H272A H2CO HE110A HE138B HI OH1612 OH1665 OH1667 OH1720'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
{\bf ALERT:} The list of known lines in CASA is currently very
restricted, and will be increased in upcoming releases (to include lines
in ALMA bands for example).

You can use the {\tt me.spectralline} tool method to turn transition names into
frequencies 
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <16>: me.spectralline('HI')
  Out[17]: 
{'m0': {'unit': 'Hz', 'value': 1420405751.786},
 'refer': 'REST',
 'type': 'frequency'}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
(not necessary for this task, but possibly useful).

The {\tt frame} sub-parameter sets the frequency frame.  The allowed
options can be listed using the {\tt me.listcodes} method on the
{\tt me.frequency()} method, e.g.
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <17>: me.listcodes(me.frequency())
  Out[17]: 
{'extra': array([], 
      dtype='|S1'),
 'normal': array(['REST', 'LSRK', 'LSRD', 'BARY', 'GEO', 'TOPO', 'GALACTO', 'LGROUP',
       'CMB'], 
      dtype='|S8')}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The {\tt doppler} sub-parameter likewise sets the Doppler system.  The
allowed codes can be listed using the {\tt me.listcodes} method on the
{\tt me.doppler()} method,
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CASA <18>: me.listcodes(me.doppler())
  Out[18]: 
{'extra': array([], 
      dtype='|S1'),
 'normal': array(['RADIO', 'Z', 'RATIO', 'BETA', 'GAMMA', 'OPTICAL', 'TRUE',
       'RELATIVISTIC'], 
      dtype='|S13')}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
For most cases the {\tt 'RADIO''} Doppler system is appropriate, but
be aware of differences.

For more information on frequency frames and spectral coordinate
systems, see the paper by Greisen et al. (A\&A, 446, 747, 2006)
\footnote{Also at \url{http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~egreisen/scs.ps}}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Printing from {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.print}

There are two ways to get hardcopy plots in {\tt plotxy}.  

The first is to use the ``disk save'' icon from the interactive plot GUI to 
print the current plot.  This will bring up a sub-menu GUI that will
allow you to choose the filename and format.  The allowed formats are {\tt .png} (PNG), 
{\tt .eps} (EPS), and {\tt svg} (SVG).  If you give the filename with
a suffix ({\tt .png}, {\tt .eps}, or {\tt svg}) it will make a plot of
that type.  Otherwise it will put a suffix on depending on the format
chosen from the menu.

{\bf ALERT:} The plot files produced by the EPS option can be
large, and the SVG files can be very large.  The PNG is the smallest.

The second is to specify a {\tt figfile}.  You probably want to disable the
GUI using {\tt interactive=False} in this case.  The type of plot file
that is made will depend upon the filename suffix.  The allowed
choices are {\tt .png} (PNG), {\tt .eps} (EPS), and {\tt svg} (SVG).

This latter option is most useful from scripts.  For example,
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   default('plotxy')
   vis = 'ngc5921.ms'
   field = '2'
   spw = ''
   xaxis = 'uvdist'
   yaxis = 'amp'
   interactive=False
   figfile = 'ngc5921.uvplot.amp.png'
   plotxy()
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
will plot amplitude versus uv-distance in PNG format.  No {\tt plotxy}
GUI will appear.

{\bf ALERT:} if
you use this option to print to {\tt figfile} with an {\tt iteration}
set, you will only get the first plot.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Exiting {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.exit}

You can use the {\bf Quit} button to clear the plot from the
window and detach from the MS.  You can also dismiss the 
window by killing it with the X on the frame, which will also
detach the MS.

You can also just leave it alone.  The plotter pretty much keeps running
in the background even when it looks like it's done!  You can
keep doing stuff in the plotter window, which is where the
{\tt overplot} parameter comes in.  Note that the {\tt plotcal}
task (\S~\ref{section:cal.tables.plotcal}) will use the same window, and
can also overplot on the same panel.

If you leave {\tt plotxy} running, beware of (for instance)
deleting or writing over the MS without stopping.  It may work
from a memory version of the MS or crash.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Example session using {\tt plotxy}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotxy.example}

The following is an example of interactive plotting and flagging
using {\tt plotxy} on the Jupiter 6cm continuum VLA dataset.
This is extracted from the script {\tt jupiter6cm\_usecase.py}
available in the script area.

This assumes that the MS {\tt jupiter6cm.usecase.ms} is
on disk with {\tt flagautocorr} already run.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
default('plotxy')

vis = 'jupiter6cm.usecase.ms'

# The fields we are interested in: 1331+305,JUPITER,0137+331
selectdata = True

# First we do the primary calibrator
field = '1331+305'

# Plot only the RR and LL for now
correlation = 'RR LL'

# Plot amplitude vs. uvdist
xaxis = 'uvdist'
yaxis = 'amp'
multicolor = 'both'

# The easiest thing is to iterate over antennas
iteration = 'antenna'

plotxy()

# You'll see lots of low points as you step through RR LL RL LR
# A basic clip at 0.75 for RR LL and 0.055 for RL LR will work
# If you want to do this interactively, set
iteration = ''

plotxy()

# You can also use flagdata to do this non-interactively
# (see below)

# Now look at the cross-polar products
correlation = 'RL LR'

plotxy()

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now do calibrater 0137+331

xaxis = 'time'
spw = '1'
correlation = ''

# Note that the strings like antenna='9' first try to match the 
# NAME which we see in listobs was the number '9' for ID=8.
# So be careful here (why naming antennas as numbers is bad).
antenna = '9'

plotxy()

# YES! the last 4 scans are bad.  Box 'em and flag.

# Go back and clean up
xaxis = 'uvdist'
spw = ''
antenna = ''
correlation = 'RR LL'

plotxy()

# Box up the bad low points (basically a clip below 0.52) and flag

# Note that RL,LR are too weak to clip on.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Finally, do JUPITER
field = 'JUPITER'
correlation = ''
iteration = ''
xaxis = 'time'

plotxy()

# Here you will see that the final scan at 22:00:00 UT is bad
# Draw a box around it and flag it!

# Now look at whats left
correlation = 'RR LL'
xaxis = 'uvdist'
spw = '1'
antenna = ''
iteration = 'antenna'

plotxy()

# As you step through, you will see that Antenna 9 (ID=8) is often 
# bad in this spw. If you box and do Locate (or remember from
# 0137+331) its probably a bad time.

# The easiset way to kill it:

antenna = '9'
iteration = ''
xaxis = 'time'
correlation = ''

plotxy()

# Draw a box around all points in the last bad scans and flag 'em!

# Now clean up the rest
xaxis = 'uvdist'
correlation = 'RR LL'
antenna = ''
spw = ''

# You will be drawing many tiny boxes, so remember you can
# use the ESC key to get rid of the most recent box if you
# make a mistake.

plotxy()

# Note that the end result is we've flagged lots of points
# in RR and LL.  We will rely upon imager to ignore the
# RL LR for points with RR LL flagged!

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsection{Plotting antenna positions using {\tt plotants}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotants}

This task is a simple plotting interface (to the {\tt plotxy}
functionality) to produce plots of the antenna positions (taken from
the {\tt ANTENNA} sub-table of the MS).

The inputs to {\tt plotants} are:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#  plotants :: Plot the antenna distribution in the local reference frame:
vis       =         ''   #  Name of input visibility file (MS)
figfile   =         ''   #  Save the plotted figure to this file
async     =      False   #  
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Plotting uv-coverages {\tt plotuv}}
\label{section:edit.plot.plotuv}


A simple way to plot uv-coverages is offered by the task {\tt
  plotuv}:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
#  plotuv :: Plot the baseline distribution
vis                 =         ''        #  Name of input visibility file (MS)

array               =         ''        #  Select (sub)array(s) by array ID number
maxnpts             =     100000        #  Maximum number of points per plot.
colors              = ['r', 'y', 'g', 'b'] #  a list of matplotlib color codes
symb                =        ','        #  A matplotlib plot symbol code
ncycles             =          1        #  How many times to cycle through colors per
                                        #   plot.
figfile             =         ''        #  Save the plotted figure(s) using this name
async               =      False        #  If true the taskname must be started using
                                        #   plotuv(...)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\tt plotuv} provides basic selection of data as well as plotting
style options. The difference to {\tt plotms} is that {\tt plotuv} is
also plotting the Hermitian conjugates of the visibilities which
produces the familiar symmetric plots. This is a remedy to the
restriction in {\tt plotms} to allow flagging of data. This is
achieved via a unambiguous link from a displayed data point to a
visibility. Plotting Hermitian conjugates would break this rule in
{\tt plotms} and {\tt plotuv} is used instead to plot Hermitian
conjugates.

\section{Data Flagging using {\tt flagdata}}
\label{section:edit.flagdata}

{\tt flagdata} can flag measurement sets and calibration tables with
an elaborate selection syntax. It also contains auto-flagging
routines. 

For a full description of {\tt flagdata} please visit:

\url{http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~rurvashi/FlaggerDocs/FlaggerDocs.html}

The inputs to {\tt flagdata} are:

\small
\begin{verbatim}

     flagbackup     =       True        #  Back up the state of flags before the run

savepars            =      False        #  Save the current parameters to the FLAG_CMD table or to a file
async               =      False        #  If true the taskname must be started using flagdata(...)

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\tt vis} can take a measurement set or calibration table. Data
selection for calibration tables is limited to {\tt field, scan, time,
  antenna, spw, and observation}. Since calibration tables do not have
a FLAG\_CMD table, parameter settings, if requested, can only be
saved in external files. 

The {\tt mode} parameter (\S \ref{section:edit.flagdata.mode}) selects the flagging algorithm and the following are available:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
list        = list of flagging commands to apply to MS
manual      = flagging based on specific selection parameters
clip        = clip data according to values
quack       = remove/keep specific time range at scan beginning/end
shadow      = remove antenna-shadowed data
elevation   = remove data below/above given elevations
tfcrop      = automatic identification of outliers on the time-freq plane
rflag       = automatic detection of outliers based on sliding-window RMS filters
extend      = extend and/or grow flags beyond what the basic algorithms detect
summary     = report the amount of flagged data
unflag      = unflag the specified data
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Flagging will only be applied to the data selection that is performed
with the usual selection parameters (\S~\ref{section:io.selection}).
The dataset is iterated-through in chunks (small pieces of data)
consisting of one field, one spw, and a user-defined timerange
(default is one scan). In addition to the typical antenna, spw,
timerange, etc. selections, we would like to point out some addition
of the {\tt correlation} syntax for modes {\tt clip, tfcrop}, and {\tt
  rflag}. One can combine correlation products with simple
mathematical expressions  

\small
\begin{verbatim}
'ABS', 'ARG', 'RE', 'IM', 'NORM' 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
followed by the polarization products (using an underscore in between ``\_'' )

\small
\begin{verbatim}
'ALL', 'I', 'XX', 'YY', 'RR', 'LL', 'WVR' 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\tt 'WVR'} refers to the water vapour radiometer of ALMA data. Note that
the operators {\tt ABS,ARG,RE}, etc are written only once as the first
value.  if more than one correlation is given, the operator will be
applied to all of them. An example would be 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
correlation='RE_XX,XY'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

which would select all real XX and XY polarization for flagging. 

\subsection{The {\tt action} parameter}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.action}

The keyword {\tt action} controls whether the actual flagging
commands will be applied or not and the options are the empty string
{\tt ''}, {\tt 'apply'} and {\tt 'calculate'}.

{\tt apply} is likely the most popular one as it applies the flags to the MS:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =    'apply'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (none/apply/calculate)
     display        =         ''        #  Display data and/or end-of-MS reports at runtime
                                        #   (data/report/both).
     flagbackup     =       True        #  Back up the state of flags before the run
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\tt flagbackup} specifies if a backup of the current flags should be
saved in the {\tt ``*.flagversions''} file. {\tt display} can be {\tt
  '', 'data', 'report', 'both'} where the empty string {\tt ''} will
report no individual flagging statistics, whereas {\tt 'data'}
launches an interactive GUI to display data and flags for each chunk to
browse through. The plots are time-frequency planes and both old and
new flags are being overlaid for all correlations per baseline. In the
GUI, one can step though all chunks for inspection and if the flagging
is unsatisfactory, one can exit without applying the flags. If the
flagging is acceptable, it is also possible to continue flagging
without viewing all chunks (the number of chunks can be very large for
typical JVLA and ALMA data sets. {\tt display='report'} lists the
flagging statistics at the end of the procedure on the screen and {\tt
  both} starts the GUI and reports all statistics at the end.


{\tt action='calculate'} calculates the flags but does not write them
to the MS or calibration table. This is useful if one would like to
inspect the computed flags in the GUI without a straight application:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              = 'calculate'       #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (none/apply/calculate)
     display        =         ''        #  Display data and/or end-of-MS reports at runtime
                                        #   (data/report/both).
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The empty string {\tt action=''} will do nothing and is useful when the
commands themselves shall only be written to the {\tt FLAG\_CMD}
sub-table or to an external file using the {\tt savepars} parameter to
specify the filename.

{\tt savepars} will save the flagging commands to a file that can be
later used for input in {\tt flagdata} via {\tt mode='list'}. It also
shares the {\tt flagcmd} syntax and can be used there. The file name
is specified by {\tt outfile} and, if empty, the {\tt FLAG\_CMD} table
in the MS will be populated.  A {\tt REASON} can be given by the {\tt
  reason} keyword which may be useful for bookkeeping as well as for
unflagging data that are marked by specific {\tt REASON}
keywords.




\subsection{Flagging Modes}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode}

\subsubsection{Manual Flag/Unflag}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.manual}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =   'manual'        #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/el
                                        #   evation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary)
     field          =         ''        #  Field names or field index numbers: '' ==> all,
                                        #   field='0~2,3C286'
     spw            =         ''        #  Spectral-window/frequency/channel: '' ==> all,
                                        #   spw='0:17~19'
     antenna        =         ''        #  Antenna/baselines: '' ==> all, antenna
                                        #   ='3,VA04'
     timerange      =         ''        #  Time range: '' ==>
                                        #   all,timerange='09:14:0~09:54:0'
     correlation    =         ''        #  Correlation: '' ==> all, correlation='XX,YY'
     scan           =         ''        #  Scan numbers: '' ==> all
     intent         =         ''        #  Observation intent: '' ==> all,
                                        #   intent='CAL*POINT*'
     array          =         ''        #  (Sub)array numbers: '' ==> all
     uvrange        =         ''        #  UV range: '' ==> all; uvrange ='0~100klambda',
                                        #   default units=meters
     observation    =         ''        #  Observation ID: '' ==> all
     feed           =         ''        #  Multi-feed numbers: Not yet implemented
     autocorr       =      False        #  Flag auto-correlations
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The {\tt 'manual'} mode is the most straight-forward of all modes. All
visibilities that are selected by the various data selection
parameters will be flagged or unflagged, depending on the {\tt
  action} parameter. {\tt autocorr} is a shorthand for {\tt
  antenna='*\&\&\&'} to flag all auto correlations in the data.


\subsubsection{List}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.list}


\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =     'list'        #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/el
                                        #   evation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary)
     inpfile        =         ''        #  Input ASCII file, list of files or Python list of strings with 

                                        #   flag commands.
     reason         =      'any'        #  Select by REASON types
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

A list of ﬂag commands can be provided through a ﬁle or a list of
files, speciﬁed by the {\tt inpfile} parameter.  Each input line may
contain a flagging {\tt mode} with data selection parameters as well
as parameters that are specific to that {\tt mode}. All parameters
that are not set will be reset to their default values (default {\tt
  mode} is {\tt 'manual'}). Each line of this file or list of strings
will be taken as a command to the {\tt flagdata} task. This {\tt
  mode=’list’} is similar to the task flagcmd with the {\tt
  inpmode=’list’} option.

An example for such a file would be: 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode='shadow'
mode='clip' clipminmax=[0,5] correlation='ABS_ALL'
mode='quack' quackmode='end' quackinterval=1.0
antenna='ea01' timerange='00:00:00~01:00:00'
antenna='ea11' timerange='00:00:00~03:00:00' spw='0~4'
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Alternatively, this can be issued in the task directly like:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
flagdata(vis='vis',mode='list',
inpfile=["mode='shadow'",
         "mode='clip' clipminmax=[0,5] correlation='ABS_ALL'",
         "mode='quack' quackmode='end' quackinterval=1.0"'
         "antenna='ea01' timerange='00:00:00~01:00:00'",
         "antenna='ea11' timerange='00:00:00~03:00:00' spw='0~4'"])
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
or via a variable
\small
\begin{verbatim}
cmds=["mode=’shadow’,
           "mode=’clip’ clipminmax=[0,5] correlation=’ABS_ALL’",
           "mode=’quack’ quackmode=’end’ quackinterval=1.0",
           "antenna=’ea01’ timerange=’00:00:00~01:00:00’",
           "antenna=’ea11’ timerange=’00:00:00~03:00:00’ spw=’0~4’"]


flagdata(vis='vis',mode='list', inpfile=cmds)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The syntax should be written with quotes e.g. {\tt mode='manual'
  antenna='ea10'} but will usually also be accepted without the quotes
(like {\tt mode=manual antenna=ea10}). Spaces are only allowed to
separate pairs of parameters, not adjacent to the equal '=' signs or
inside strings and there are no commas between the subparameters on each line.




\subsubsection{Clip}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.clip}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =     'clip'        #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/
                                        #  elevation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary)
...
     datacolumn     =     'DATA'        #  Data column on which to operate
                                        #   (data,corrected,model,residual)
     clipminmax     =         []        #  Range to use for clipping
     clipoutside    =       True        #  Clip outside the range, or within it
     channelavg     =      False        #  Average over channels (scalar average)
     clipzeros      =      False        #  Clip zero-value data
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

in addition to the regular selection parameters, {\tt mode='clip'}
also has an option to select between the {\tt DATA}, {\tt
  CORRECTED\_DATA} and other scratch columns for 
operation. {\tt clipminmax} selects the range of values to be clipped
-- usually this is combined with {\tt clipoutside=True} to clip
everything {\it but} the values covered in {\tt clipminmax}. The data can
also be averaged over the selected {\tt spw} channel ranges by setting
{\tt channelavg=True}. {\tt clip} will also flag 'NaN', 'inf', and
'-inf' values by default and can flag exact zero values (these are sometimes
produced by the JVLA correlator) using the {\tt clipzeros} parameter.


Note : For modes {\tt clip, tfcrop} and {\tt rflag}, channel-ranges
can be excluded from flagging by selecting ranges such as {\tt
  spw='0:0\~5;10\~63'}. This is a way to protect known spectral-lines
from being flagged by the autoflag algorithms.


\subsubsection{Shadow}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.shadow}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =   'shadow'        #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/
                                        #  elevation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary)
...
     tolerance      =        0.0        #  Amount of shadow allowed (in meters)
     addantenna     =         ''        #  File name or dictionary with additional antenna names,
                                        #   positions and diameters
\end{verbatim}

\normalsize 

This option flags shadowed antennas, i.e. when one antenna blocks
part of the aperture of a second antenna that is behind the first
one. Shadowing can be gradual and the criterion for a shadow flag is
when a baseline is shorter than ${\rm radius}_1 + {\rm radius}_2 - {\rm tolerance}$
(where the radii of the antennae are taken from the MS antenna
subtable). {\tt addantenna} may be used to account for shadowing when
antennas are not listed in the MS but are physically present. Please
read the {\tt flagdata} inline help for the syntax of this option.


\subsubsection{Quack}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.quack}
\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =    'quack'        #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/
                                        #   elevation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary)
...
     quackinterval  =        0.0        #  Quack n seconds from scan beginning or end
     quackmode      =      'beg'        #  Quack mode. 'beg' ==> beginning of scan.'endb' ==> end of
                                        #   scan. 'end' ==> all but end of scan. 'tail' ==> all but
                                        #   beginning of scan
     quackincrement =      False        #  Flag incrementally in time?
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

{\tt quack} is used to remove data at scan boundaries. {\tt
  quackinterval} specifies the time in seconds to be flagged, and {\tt
  quackmode} can be {\tt 'beg'} to flag the {\tt quackinterval} at the
beginning of each selected scan, {\tt 'endb'} at the end of scan. {\tt
  'tail'} flags all but the beginning of scan and {\tt 'end'} all but
the end of scan. The {\tt quackincrement} is either {\tt True} or {\tt
  False}, depending if one wishes to flag the {\tt quackinterval} from
the first unflagged data in the scan, or from the scan boundaries
independent of data being already flagged or not.

\subsubsection{Elevation}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.elevation}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                = 'elevation'       #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/
                                        #   elevation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary)
...
     lowerlimit     =        0.0        #  Lower limiting elevation (in degrees)
     upperlimit     =       90.0        #  Upper limiting elevation (in degrees)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Flagging based on the elevation of the antennae. This may be useful to
avoid data taken at very low elevations or close to transit and the
{\tt lowerlimit} and {\tt upperlimit} parameters specify the range of
good elevations.


\subsubsection{Tfcrop}
\label{section:edit.flagdata.mode.tfcrop}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mode                =   'tfcrop'        #  Flagging mode (list/manual/clip/shadow/quack/
                                        #   elevation/tfcrop/rflag/extend/unflag/summary
                                        #   )
...
     ntime          =     'scan'        #  Time-range to use for each chunk (in seconds
                                        #   or minutes)
     combinescans   =      False        #  Accumulate data across scans.
     datacolumn     =     'DATA'        #  Data column on which to operate
                                        #   (data,corrected,model,residual)
     timecutoff     =        4.0        #  Flagging thresholds in units of deviation
                                        #   from the fit
     freqcutoff     =        3.0        #  Flagging thresholds in units of deviation
                                        #   from the fit
     timefit        =     'line'        #  Fitting function for the time direction

TFCrop is an autoflag algorithm that detects outliers on the 2D
time-frequency plane, and can operate on un-calibrated data (non
bandpass-corrected). The original implementation of this algorithm is
described in NCRA Technical Report 202 (Oct 2003).

The algorithm iterates through the data in chunks of time. For each
chunk, the result of user-specified visibility-expressions are
organized as 2D time-frequency planes, one for each baseline and
correlation-expression result, and the following steps are performed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate a bandshape template : Average the data across time, to
construct an average bandpass. Construct an estimate of a clean
bandpass (without RFI) via a robust piece-wise polynomial fit to the
average bandpass shape.

Note : A robust fit is computed in upto 5 iterations. It begins with a
straight line fit across the full range, and gradually increases to
'maxnpieces' number of pieces with third-order polynomials in each
piece. At each iteration, the stddev between the data and the fit is
computed, values beyond N-stddev are flagged, and the fit and stddev
are re-calculated with the remaining points. This stddev calculation
is adaptive, and converges to a value that reflects only the data and
no RFI. At each iteration, the same relative threshold is applied to
detect flags, and this results in a varying set of flagging
thresholds, that allows deep flagging only when the fit represents the
true data best. Iterations stop when the stddev changes by less than
10\%, or when 5 iterations are completed.

The resulting clean bandpass is a fit across the base of RFI spikes.

\item Divide out this clean bandpass function from all timesteps in the
current chunk. Now, any data points that deviate from a mean of 1 can
be considered RFI. This step helps to separate narrow-band RFI spikes
from a smooth but varying bandpass, in situations where a simple
range-based clipping will flag good sections of the bandpass.

\item Perform iterative flagging (robust flagging) of points deviating from
a value of 1.

Flagging is done in upto 5 iterations. In each iteration, for every
timestep, calculate the stddev of the bandpass-flattened data, flag
all points further than N times stddev from the fit, and recalculate
the stddev. At each iteration, the same relative threshold is applied
to detect flags. Optionally, use sliding-window based statistics to
calculate additional flags.

\item Repeat steps 1 and 3, but in the other direction (i.e. average the
data across frequency, calculate a piece-wise polynomial fit to the
average time-series, and find flags based on deviations w.r.to this
fit.)

\end{enumerate}

It is usually helpful to extend the flags along time, frequency and
correlation using the {\tt "extend"}
mode in a second step within the same flagging run. See the example
below:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  cmd=["mode='tfcrop' freqcutoff=3.0 usewindowstats='sum'", 
         "mode='extend' extendpols=True growtime=50.0 growaround=True"]
                     
  flagdata(vis, mode='list', inpfile=cmd)     
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


The default parameters of the tfcrop implementation are optimized for
strong narrow-band RFI. With broad-band RFI, the piece-wise polynomial
can sometimes model it as part of the band-shape, and therefore not
detect it as RFI. In this case, reducing the maximum number of pieces
in the polynomial can help. This algorithm usually has trouble with
noisy RFI that is also extended in time of frequency, and additional
statistics-based flagging is recommended (via the 'usewindowstats'
parameter). It is often required to set up parameters separately for
each spectral-window.

If frequency ranges of known astronomical spectral lines are known {\it 
a-priori} , they can be protected from automatic flagging by
de-selecting those frequency-ranges via the 'spw' data-selection
parameter.

RFlag is an autoflag algorithm based on a sliding window statistical
filter. The RFlag algorithm was originally developed by Eric Greisen
in AIPS (31DEC11).  AIPS documentation : Subsection E.5 of the AIPS
cookbook (Appendix E : Special Considerations for JVLA data
calibration and imaging in AIPS)

In RFlag, the data is iterated-through in chunks of time, statistics
are accumulated across time-chunks, thresholds are calculated at the
end, and applied during a second pass through the dataset.

The CASA implementation also optionally allows a single-pass operation
where statistics and thresholds are computed and also used for
flagging, within each time-chunk (defined by 'ntime' and
'combinescans').

For each chunk, calculate local statistics, and apply flags based on
user supplied (or auto-calculated) thresholds.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Time analysis (for each channel)
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Calculate local rms of real and imag visibilities, within a sliding time window
      \item Calculate the median rms across time windows, deviations of local rms from this median, and the median deviation
      \item Flag if local rms is larger than timedevscale x (medianRMS + medianDev)
   \end{enumerate}
\item Spectral analysis (for each time)
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item Calculate avg of real and imag visibilities and their rms across channels
       \item Calculate the deviation of each channel from this avg, and the median-deviation
       \item Flag if deviation is larger than freqdevscale x medianDev
   \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

It is usually helpful to extend the flags along time, frequency and
correlation using the {\tt "extend"}
mode in a second step within the same flagging run. See the example
below:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
  cmd=["mode='tfcrop' freqcutoff=3.0 usewindowstats='sum'", 
         "mode='extend' extendpols=True growtime=50.0 growaround=True"]

The {\tt extend} mode may be most useful after running the {\tt
  tfcrop} or {\tt rflag} autoflagging procedures. Sometimes, these
algorithms leave small islands of unflagged data behind, data that are
surrounded by flagged visibilities in the time-frequency
space. Although the algorithm may deem these visibilities as good
ones, they are frequently affected by low-level RFI that spills from
the adjacent, flagged points and one may wish to clean those up.


{\tt ntime} specifies the time ranges over which to clean up,
e.g. {\tt '1.5min'} or {\tt 'scan'} which checks on all data within a
scan. To span time ranges larger than scans, one can set {\tt
  combinescans} to {\tt True}.

{\tt extendpols=True} would extend all flags to all polarization
products when at least one of them is flagged.

{\tt growtime} flags the entire time range for a flagged channel,
when a certain fraction of flagged time intervals is exceeded. 

{\tt growfreq} is similar but extends the flags in frequency when a given
fraction of channels is already flagged.

{\tt growaround} checks for flagged data points in the time-frequency
domain that neighbor a datum. The threshold is four data points. If
more surrounding points are flagged, the central datum will be
flagged, too.

{\tt flagneartime} flags adjacent data points along the time axis, around a flagged datum

{\tt  flagnearfreq} flags neighboring channels.

\section{Command-based flagging using {\tt flagcmd}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd}

The task {\tt flagcmd} will flag the visibility data set or
calibration table based on a specified set of flagging commands using
a flagging syntax (see \S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.syntax}).  These
commands can be input from the {\tt FLAG\_CMD} MS table, from a {\tt
  Flag.xml} SDM table, from an ascii file, or from input python
strings.  Facilities for manipulation, listing, or plotting of these
flags are also provided.

The inputs to {\tt flagcmd} are:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#  flagcmd :: Flagging task based on batches of flag-commands
vis                 =         ''        #  Name of MS file or calibration table to flag
inpmode             =    'table'        #  Input mode for flag commands(table/list/xml)
     inpfile        =         ''        #  Source of flag commands
     tablerows      =         []        #  Rows of inpfile to read
     reason         =      'any'        #  Select by REASON types
     useapplied     =      False        #  Select commands whose rows have APPLIED column set to True

action              =    'apply'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
     flagbackup     =       True        #  Automatically backup the FLAG column before execution

savepars            =      False        #  Save flag commands to the MS or to a file
async               =      False        #  If true the taskname must be started using flagcmd(...)

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The default input mode is {\tt inpmode='table'} which directs the
task to input flag commands from the {\tt FLAG\_CMD} internal MS
table. See \S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode} for more options.

The default operation mode is {\tt action='apply'} directing the
task to apply relevant flagging commands to the MS data main table.
See \S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action} for more options.

See \S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.syntax} for a description of the
flagging command syntax.

It is possible to flag calibration tables using {\tt flagcmd}, although we
recommend using the {\tt flagdata} task for this.
    
When using {\tt flagcmd} to flag calibration tables, only the {\tt
  apply} and {\tt list} actions are supported.  Because calibration
tables do not have a FLAG\_CMD sub-table, the default {\tt
  inpmode='table'} can only be used if an MS is given in the {\tt
  inpfile} parameter so that flags from the MS are applied to the
calibration table directly. Otherwise, the flag commands must be given
using {\tt inpmode='list'}, either from a file or from a list of strings.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Input modes {\tt inpmode}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode}

The {\tt inpmode} parameter selects options for the input mode for
the flagging commands.

Available {\tt inpmode} options are:
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt 'table'} --- input from MS table (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode.table})
   \item {\tt 'list'} --- input from ASCII file or from a list of
     strings (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode.list})
   \item {\tt 'xml'} --- input from XML table (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode.xml})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input mode {\tt 'table'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode.table}

The default input mode is {\tt inpmode='table'} which directs the
task to input flag commands from a {\tt FLAG\_CMD} MS table.  
This has the sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
inpmode             =    'table'        #  Input mode for flag commands(table/list/xml)
     inpfile        =         ''        #  Source of flag commands
     tablerows      =         []        #  Rows of inpfile to read
     reason         =      'any'        #  Select by REASON types
     useapplied     =      False        #  Select commands whose rows have APPLIED column set to
                                        #   True
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

If {\tt inpfile = ''} then it will look for the {\tt FLAG\_CMD} 
table in the MS given by {\tt vis}. You can use this sub-parameter to
direct the task to look directly at another table.

The {\tt tablerows} sub-parameter is a simple Python list of the row
numbers of the table to consider in processing flags.  The default is
all rows.

The {\tt useapplied} sub-parameter toggles whether only flag commands
marked as not having been applied are considered (the default), or
to allow (re)processing using all commands.

The {\tt reason} sub-parameter selects the {\tt REASON} type to
process.  The default {\tt 'any'} means all commands, note that
{\tt reason=''} would only select flags who have a blank {\tt REASON}
column entry.

One use case is to read the flag commands from the FLAG\_CMD of an MS
and apply them to a calibration table given in the parameter
{\tt vis}. Example:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
     flagcmd(vis='cal-X54.B1', inpmode='table', inpfile='uid___A002_X2a5c2f_X54.ms', action='apply')
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\subsubsection{Input flag mode {\tt 'list'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode.list}
This mode allows one to insert a list of strings with ﬂagging
commands, the name of a ﬁle or a list of filenames that contains these
commands equivalent to the {\tt mode='list'} in {\tt flagdata}
(\S\,\ref{section:edit.flagdata.mode.list}). E.g. a file {\it
  flags.txt} that contains \small
\begin{verbatim}
scan='1~3' mode='manual'
mode='clip' clipminmax=[0,2] correlation='ABS_XX' clipoutside=False
spw='9' mode='tfcrop' correlation='ABS_YY' ntime=51.0
mode='extend' extendpols=True
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
can be called via  
\small
\begin{verbatim}
flagcmd(vis,inpmode='list',inpfile='flags.txt')
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Alternatively, the individual flagging commands can
be directly provided in the call itself like 
\small
\begin{verbatim}
inpfile=["scan='1~3' mode='manual'", 
         "mode='clip' clipminmax=[0,2] correlation='ABS_XX' clipoutside=False",
         "spw='9' mode='tfcrop' correlation='ABS_YY' ntime=51.0",
         "mode='extend' extendpols=True"]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize



\subsubsection{Input flag mode {\tt 'xml'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.inpmode.xml}

The input mode {\tt inpmode='xml'} directs the
task to input flag commands from a XML SDM online flagging 
{\tt Flag.xml} file.  
When set this opens the sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
inpmode             =      'xml'        #  Input mode for flag commands(table/list/xml)
     tbuff          =        0.0        #  Time buffer (sec) to pad flags
     ants           =         ''        #  Allowed flag antenna names to select by
     reason         =      'any'        #  Select by REASON types
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
%Set {\tt flagfile} to the path to the file.  The default 
%{\tt flagfile=''} in 

This mode will look for a file called {\tt Flag.xml} inside the MS
directory specified under {\tt vis}.  Note that if the data was filled
from the SDM using {\tt importevla} (\S~\ref{section:io.import.evla})
then the relevant XML file will have been copied to the MS already.

The {\tt tbuff} sub-parameter sets a padding buffer (in seconds)
to the begin and end times of the online flags in the XML file.
As in {\tt importevla}, the online flag time buffer {\tt tbuff} is specified in
seconds, but in fact should be keyed to the intrinsic online 
integration time to allow for events (like slewing) that occur
within an integration period.  This is particularly true for JVLA data,
where a {\tt tbuff} value of $0.5\times$ to $1.5\times$ the
integration time is needed.  For example, if data were taken with
1-second integrations, then at least {\tt tbuff=0.5} should be used,
likewise {\tt tbuff=5} for 10-second integrations.
{\bf Note:} For JVLA data you should use $1.5\times$ (e.g.\ 
{\tt tbuff=15} for 10-second integrations) for data taken in 
early 2011 or before due to a timing error.  We do not yet know what
ALMA data will need for padding (if any).

The {\tt ants} sub-parameter selects the antennas from which
online flags will be selected (default is all antennas).  For example,
{\tt ants='ea01'} is a valid choice for JVLA data.

The {\tt reason} sub-parameter selects by the {\tt REASON} field in
the {\tt Flag.xml} file.  The default {\tt 'any'} means all commands.
Note that {\tt reason=''} would only select flags who have a blank {\tt REASON}
field entry.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Operation types {\tt action}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action}

The {\tt action} selects options for operating on the selected
flags and possibly the data.

Available {\tt action} options are:
\begin{itemize}
   \item {\tt 'apply'} --- apply flag commands to data (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action.apply})
   \item {\tt 'unapply'} --- unapply flags in data (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action.unapply})
   \item {\tt 'list'} ---  list and/or save flag commands (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action.list})
   \item {\tt 'plot'} --- plot flag commands (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action.plot})
   \item {\tt 'clear'} --- clear rows from {\tt FLAG\_CMD} table (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action.clear})
   \item {\tt 'extract'} --- extract internal flag dictionary (\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.action.extract})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Apply flags --- {\tt optype} option {\tt 'apply'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action.apply}

The default operation mode is {\tt action='apply'} directing the
task to apply relevant flagging commands to the vis data main table.

\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =    'apply'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
     flagbackup     =       True        #  Automatically backup the
                                        # FLAG column before execution

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
%
%The {\tt outfile} sub-parameter tells where to record the applied
%flags after application to the data.  If {\tt flagmode='table'} and 
%{\tt flagmode=''} (the flag commands come from the {\tt FLAG\_CMD}
%table) then this is the the default option {\tt outfile=''} will set
%the {\tt APPLIED} column value to {\tt True} in the relevant row of
%the table.  If the flag commands came from elsewhere, then they will
%be added to the {\tt FLAG\_CMD} table and marked as applied. If
%{\tt flagmode} is non-blank, then the commands will be written to the
%indicated ASCII file, but not recorded or marked as applied in the
%{\tt FLAG\_CMD} table.
%
%The {\tt flagsort} sub-parameter, when non-blank, directs the sorting
%of flags by the options {\tt 'antenna'}, {\tt 'id'}, or {\tt
%  'reason'}.  The default option {\tt 'antenna'} is most useful, in
%particular for cases where the only selection is by antenna-time
%(e.g.\ from current JVLA online flags).  In the case the number of
%flagging agents activated at the tool level is minimized, the flagging
%will be most efficient.  You can also sort by {\tt id} (same as {\tt
%  ''}, keeping each flag separate) and by {\tt 'reason'} (not
%particularly useful yet).

The {\tt flagbackup} toggle sets whether a new copy of the MS main
table {\tt FLAG} column is written to the {\tt .flagversions} backup
directory for that MS before the requested flagging operation.

%The {\tt reset} toggle determines whether {\em all} flags in the MS
%are reset (to ``unflagged'') before applying the current set of
%flagging commands.  This is equivalent to unflagging all the data
%and starting fresh with the new flags.  
%{\bf ALERT:} Use this option with care!

\subsubsection{Unapply flags --- {\tt action} option {\tt 'unapply'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action.unapply}

The {\tt unapply} option allows unflagging of data based on the selected flag commands.
This choice opens the sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =  'unapply'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
     flagbackup     =       True        #  Automatically backup the FLAG column before execution

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

As in {\tt action='apply'}, it is possible to make a backup to the
{\tt *.flagversions} file by using {\tt flagbackup=True}.  

In order to guarantee that only the data selected in the command is
unapplied, the framework will first unapply the selected rows and then
re-apply the overlapping data that got unapplied in the first
pass. This is a true unapply action, but it will take longer to
process because it will re-apply all the remaining commands that have
APPLIED = True!


%
%The {\tt flagsort} and {\tt flagbackup} sub-parameters behave in this
%option as they do in {\tt optype='apply'} 
%(\S~\ref{section:edit.flagcmd.optype.apply}).

%{\tt ALERT:} Flags based on the {\tt shadow} flagging option cannot be
%undone by this method.  You will need to reset all flags and then do
%all other flagging operations (or revert to an appropriate backup of
%the flags using {\tt flagmanager}).


\subsubsection{List flags --- {\tt action='list'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action.list}

The {\tt 'list'} option will give a listing of the flagging commands.
This choice opens the sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =     'list'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        # (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
savepars            =       True        #  Save flag commands to the MS or to a file
     outfile        =         ''        #  Name of output file to save commands
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This action lists the commands on the screen without applying
them. One can save the flagging script to an file specified in the
{\tt outfile} parameter when {\tt savepars=True}. If {\tt outfile} is
empty, it will save the commands to the MS given in {\tt vis}.



The format of the listing output depends on the source of the flagging
commands. A set of flagging commands specified through 
{\tt inpmode='list'} will be listed directly. The
flagging commands extracted through {\tt inpmode='table'} will
reflect the columns in the table:
\begin{verbatim}
        'Row', 'Timerange', 'Reason', 'Type', 'Applied', 'Lev', 'Sev', 'Command'
\end{verbatim}
while commands from {\tt inpmode='xml'} will be shown with the SDM
XML table fields:
\begin{verbatim}
        'Key', 'FlagID', 'Antenna', 'Reason', 'Timerange'
\end{verbatim}



\subsubsection{Plot flags --- {\tt action='plot'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action.plot}

The {\tt 'plot'} option will produce a graphical plot of flags of time versus antenna.
This choice opens the sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =     'plot'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
     plotfile       =         ''        #  Name of output file to save plot
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
This is only useful for online flags or general flag commands that are
specified by antenna plus timerange using the standard {\tt REASON}
codes that are known SDM {\tt Flag.xml} enumerations.

If the {\tt plotfile} sub-parameter is non-blank, then a plotfile will
be made with that name instead of appearing in a matplotlib plotter window
on the users workstation.

{\tt ALERT:} The plotted enumerations are currently only those known
to be allowed JVLA online flags as of 15 April 2011, and include:
\begin{verbatim}
        'FOCUS', 'SUBREFLECTOR', 'OFF SOURCE', 'NOT IN SUBARRAY'
\end{verbatim}
with all others being plotted as {\tt 'Other'}.

\subsubsection{Clear flags --- {\tt action='clear'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action.clear}

The {\tt 'clear'} action will delete selected rows from the 
{\tt FLAG\_CMD} MS table.
This choice opens the sub-parameters:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =    'clear'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
     clearall       =      False        #  Delete all rows from FLAG_CMD
     rowlist        =         []        #  FLAG_CMD rows to clear
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The {\tt rowlist} sub-parameter is a simple Python list of the row
numbers of the table to consider in processing flags.  The default is
a blank list which indicates the desire to clear all rows.

In either case, if {\tt clearall=False} then nothing will
happen by default as a safeguard.  If {\tt clearall=True}, then a 
blank list will direct the deletion of the selected rows from the table.

{\bf ALERT:} Use this option with care.  You can easily mess up the
{\tt FLAG\_CMD} table.

\subsubsection{Extract Flag Commands--- {\tt action='extract'}}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.action.extract}

The {\tt 'extract'} option will return the internal flagging dictionary to
              python:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
action              =  'extract'        #  Action to perform in MS and/or in inpfile
                                        #   (apply/unapply/list/plot/clear/extract)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The value can be returned to a variable like: 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
myflagd = flagcmd(vis=msfile,useapplied=True,action='extract')
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Flagging command syntax}
\label{section:edit.flagcmd.syntax}

A flagging command syntax has been devised to populate the {\tt
COMMAND} column of the {\tt FLAG\_CMD} table and to direct the 
operation of the {\tt flagcmd} task.

The syntax is similar to {\tt flagdata}, so please check {\tt help
  flagdata} for more info. 

You can also use {\tt help flagcmd} inside casapy for this syntax guide also.

Commands are a string (which may contain internal "strings")
consisting of {\tt KEY=VALUE} pairs separated by whitespace (see examples
below).

{\it NOTE: There should be no whitespace between KEY=VALUE or within each
KEY or VALUE, since the simple parser first breaks command lines on
whitespace, then on "=".}
        
Each key should only appear once on a given command line/string
        
There is an implicit {\tt "mode"} for each command, with the default being
{\tt 'manual'} if not given.

Comment lines can start with '\#' and will be ignored.
     

\begin{enumerate}
        
\item Data selection parameters (used by all flagging modes, see also \S\,\ref{section:io.selection}) 

\small
\begin{verbatim}        
timerange='' 
antenna='' 
spw='' 
correlation='' 
field='' 
scan='' 
feed=''
array='' 
uvrange='' 
intent='' 
observation=''
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
        

Note: a command consisting only of selection key-value pairs is a
basic {\tt "manual"} operation, ie. flag the data meeting the selection
          
        
\item Modes specific parameters with default values (for further details,

\section{Browse the Data}
\label{section:edit.browse}

The {\tt browsetable} task is available for viewing data directly
(and handles all CASA tables, including Measurement Sets, calibration tables,
and images). This task brings up the CASA Qt
{\tt casabrowser}, which is a separate program.  You can launch this
from outside {\tt casapy}.  

The default inputs are:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
#  browsetable :: Browse a table (MS, calibration table, image)

tablename         =         ''  #   Name of input table
async             =      False  #  If true the taskname must be started using browsetable(...)

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Currently, its single input is the {\tt tablename}, so an example would
be:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
   browsetable('ngc5921.ms')
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
For an MS such as this, it will come up with a browser of the 
{\tt MAIN} table (see Fig~\ref{fig:qcasabrowser1}).  
If you want to look at sub-tables, use the tab 
{\bf table keywords} along the left side to bring up a panel with the sub-tables
listed (Fig~\ref{fig:qcasabrowser2}), then choose (left-click) a table and
{\bf View:Details} to bring it up (Fig~\ref{fig:qcasabrowser3}).  
You can left-click on a cell in a table to view the
contents.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\pngname{qcasabrowser1}{6}
\caption{\label{fig:qcasabrowser1} {\tt browsetable}: The browser displays
  the main table within a frame. You can scroll
  through the data (x=columns of the {\tt MAIN} table, and y=the rows) or
  select a specific page or row as desired.  By default, 1000 rows of
  the table are loaded at a time, but you can step through the MS in batches.} 
\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\pngname{qcasabrowser2}{6}
\caption{\label{fig:qcasabrowser2} {\tt browsetable}: You can use the
  tab for {\tt Table Keywords} to look at other tables within an MS.
  You can then double-click on a table to view its contents.} 
\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}
 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\pngname{qcasabrowser3}{6}
\caption{\label{fig:qcasabrowser3} {\tt browsetable}: Viewing the 
{\tt SOURCE} table of the MS.}
\hrulefill
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Note that one useful feature is that you can Edit the table and its
contents.  Use the {\tt Edit table} choice from the {\bf Edit} menu,
or click on the {\bf Edit} button.  Be careful with this, and make
a backup copy of the table before editing!

Use the {\tt Close Tables and Exit} option from the {\bf Files} menu
to quit the {\tt casabrowser}.

There are a lot of features in the {\tt casabrowser}
that are not fully documented here.  Feel free to explore the
capabilities such as plotting and sorting!

{\bf ALERT:} You are likely to find that the {\tt casabrowser}
needs to get a table lock before proceeding.  Use the {\tt clearstat}
command to clear the lock status in this case.
