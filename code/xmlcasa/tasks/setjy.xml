	<shortdescription>Fills the model column with the visibilities of a calibrator</shortdescription>
	<description>
       This task places the model visibility amp and phase associated
       with a specified clean components image into the model column
       of the data set.  The flux density (I,Q,U,V) for a point source
       calibrator can be entered explicitly.

       Models are available for 3C48, 3C138, and 3C286 between
       1.4 and 43 GHz.  3C147 is available above 13 GHz.  These models
       are scaled to the precise frequency of the data.  Only I models are
       presently available.

       The location of the models is system dependent:  At the AOC, the
       models are in the directory::/usr/lib/casapy/data/nrao/VLA/CalModels/
       3C286_L.im (egs)

       setjy need only be run on the calibrator sources with a known flux
       density and/or model.

       Solar System Objects are supported via the 'Butler-JPL-Horizons
       2010' standard.  Currently they are modeled as uniform
       temperature disks based on their ephemerides at the time of
       observation (note that this may oversimplify objects, in
       particular asteroids). Specify the name of the object in the
       'field' parameter.

<example>

    The task sets the model visibility amp and phase of a specified source
    (generally a calibrator).  The simplest way is to enter the flux density
    (I,Q,U,V) explicitly, but this is valid only for a point source.

    For an extended source, the clean model (image.model) can be
    specified and the model visibilities associated with this clean
    model is placed in the visibility model column.

    Models are available for 3C48, 3C138, 3C286 between 1.4 and 43 GHz.
    3C147 is available above 4 GHz.  These models are scaled to the precise
    frequency of the data.  Only I models are presently available.

    The location of the models is system dependent: At the AOC and CV, the
    models are in the directory::/usr/lib/casapy/data/nrao/VLA/CalModels or
    /usr/lib64/casapy/data/nrao/VLA/CalModels (depending on whether 32 or 64
    bit CASA was installed on the machine being used).  In general (using
    Python), the stock models should be in
    casa['dirs']['data'] + '/nrao/VLA/CalModels'
    setjy also looks for models in the current directory before trying
    casa['dirs']['data'] + '/nrao/VLA/CalModels'.

    setjy need only be run on the calibrator sources with a known flux
    density and/or model.

    Solar System Objects are supported via the 'Butler-JPL-Horizons 2010'
    standard.  Currently they are modeled as uniform temperature disks based
    on their ephemerides at the time of observation (note that this may
    oversimply objects, in particular asteroids).  The object name is
    obtained from the 'field' parameter.  Recognized objects are listed
    below, under 'standard'.

    Note that fluxdensity, modimage, and standard interact in a possibly
    confusing way!  Generally, if fluxdensity[0] (Stokes I) is &lt;= 0, it
    will be ignored.  If it is &lt; 0, standard (which has a default) will
    be used to calculate flux density as a function of frequency, even if
    modimage is specified.  If is is exactly 0 and modimage is given, the
    brightness of the model image will be used as is.  If fluxdensity([0])
    is &gt; 0, it will be used.  The latter two options come at the price of
    disabling frequency scaling, i.e. the same fluxdensity will be used for
    all frequencies.

    Keyword arguments:
    vis -- Name of input visibility file
            default: none.  example: vis='ngc5921.ms'
    field -- Select field using field id(s) or field name(s).
           default: ''=all fields, but run setjy one field at a time.
              [run listobs to obtain the list id's or names of calibrators]
           If field is a non-negative integer, it is assumed to be a field
           index.  Otherwise, it is taken to be a field name (case sensitive
           - it must match the name as listed by listobs).
           field='0~2'; field ids 0,1,2
           field='0,4,5~7'; field ids 0,4,5,6,7
           field='3C286,3C295'; field named 3C286 and 3C295
           field = '3,4C*'; field id 3, all names starting with 4C
    spw -- Spectral window selection string.
           default: '' = all spectral windows
           Note that setjy only selects by spectral window, and ignores
           channel selections.  Fine-grained control could be achieved using
           (and possibly constructing) a cube for modimage.

    selectdata -- Other parameters for selecting part(s) of the MS
                  to operate on.
                  (Currently all time-oriented and most likely only of
                   interest when using a Solar System object as a calibrator.)
                  default: False

  &gt;&gt;&gt; selectdata=True expandable parameters
               See help par.selectdata for more on these.

               timerange  -- Select data based on time range:
                   default: '' (all); examples,
                   timerange = 'YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss~YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss'
                   Note: if YYYY/MM/DD is missing date defaults to first 
			 day in data set
                   timerange='09:14:0~09:54:0' picks 40 min on first day
                   timerange='25:00:00~27:30:00' picks 1 hr to 3 hr 
			     30min on NEXT day
                   timerange='09:44:00' pick data within one integration 
		             of time
                   timerange='&gt;10:24:00' data after this time
                   For multiple MS input, a list of timerange strings can be
                   used:
                   timerange=['09:14:0~09:54:0','&gt;10:24:00']
                   timerange='09:14:0~09:54:0''; apply the same timerange for
                                                 all input MSes
               scan -- Scan number range.
                   default: '' (all)
                   example: scan='1~5'
                   For multiple MS input, a list of scan strings can be used:
                   scan=['0~100','10~200']
                   scan='0~100; scan ids 0-100 for all input MSes
                   Check 'go listobs' to insure the scan numbers are in order.
               observation -- Observation ID range.
                   default: '' (all)
                   example: observation='1~5'


    modimage -- Model image (I only) for setting the model visibilities.
           modimage can be a cube, and its channels do not have to exactly
           match those of vis.  It is recommended to use modimage for
           sources that are resolved by the observation, but the
           Butler-JPL-Horizons standard supplies a basic model of what
           several Solar System objects look like.  default: '': do not use
           a model image.
    
           Each field must be done separately when using a model image.  The
           flux density of the image will be scaled from the frequency in
           the model to that actually used (ignoring fluxdensity), unless
           fluxdensity &gt;= 0 (or fluxdensity[0] &gt;= 0).  If
           fluxdensity([0]) is 0.0, the image's flux density will be used.
           If fluxdensity([0]) &gt; 0.0, it will be used (and spix and
           reffreq if modimage is not a cube).  Since the spectral index
           usually varies with direction, applying a single spectral index
           to a 2D modimage is typically not as good as using a cube.

           Both the amplitude and phase are calculated.  At the AOC or CV,
           the models are located in casa['dirs']['data']
           + '/nrao/VLA/CalModels/', e.g.
           /usr/lib/casapy/data/nrao/VLA/CalModels/3C286_L.im
                lib64

           If modimage does not start with '/', setjy will look for a match
           in '.', './CalModels', and any CalModels directories within
           the casa['dirs']['data'] tree (excluding certain branches).

           Note that modimage should be deconvolved, i.e. a set of clean
           components instead of an image that has been convolved with a
           clean beam.

    listmodimages -- If True, do nothing but list candidates for modimage
           that are present on the system.  It looks for *.im* *.mod* in .,
           CalModels, and CalModels directories in the casa['dirs']['data']
           tree.  It does not check whether they are appropriate for the MS!

    scalebychan=False
            This determines whether the fluxdensity set in the model is
            calculated on a per channel basis. If False then it only one
            fluxdensity value is calculated per spw.  (Either way, all channels
            in spw are modified.)  It is effectively True if fluxdensity[0] &gt;
            0.0.

    fluxdensity -- Specified flux density [I,Q,U,V] in Jy
            default: -1, uses [1,0,0,0] flux density for unrecognized sources,
            and standard flux densities for ones recognized by 'standard',
            including 3C286, 3C48, 3C147, and several planets, moons, and
            asteroids.  setjy will try to use standard if fluxdensity is not
            positive.

            Only one flux density can be specified at a time.  The phases are
               set to zero.
            example   fluxdensity=-1  will use standard for recognized
	              calibrators (like 3C286, 3C147 and 3C48, depending on
		      standard) and insert 1.0 for selected fields with
		      unrecognized sources.
            example   field = '1'; fluxdensity=[3.2,0,0,0] wil put in 
                      a flux density of I=3.2 for field='1'

            At present (June 2000), this is the only method to insert a
            polarized flux density model.
            example:  fluxdensity=[2.63,0.21,-0.33,0.02]
                      will put in I,Q,U,V flux densities of 2.63,0.21,-0.33,
                      and 0.02, respectively, in the model column.

    spix -- Spectral index for fluxdensity:
                 S = fluxdensity * (freq/reffreq)**spix
            Default: 0 (no effect)
            Only used if fluxdensity is being used.
            N.B.: If fluxdensity is positive, and spix is nonzero, then reffreq
                  must be set too!  (See below)

                  It is applied in the same way to all polarizations, and does
                  not account for Faraday rotation or depolarization.

    reffreq -- The reference frequency for spix, given with units.
            Default: '1GHz'; this is only here to prevent division by 0!
            N.B.: If the flux density is being scaled by spectral index,
            then reffreq must be set to whatever reference frequency is
            correct for the given fluxdensity and spix.  It cannot be
            determined from vis.  On the other hand, if spix is 0, then any
            positive frequency can be used (and ignored).

            Examples: '86.0GHz', '4.65e9Hz'

    standard -- Flux density standard, used if fluxdensity[0] &lt; 0.0
            default: 'Perley-Butler 2010'; example: standard='Baars'
            Options: 'Baars','Perley 90','Perley-Taylor 95',
               'Perley-Taylor 99', 'Perley-Butler 2010',
               and 'Butler-JPL-Horizons 2010'.
            All but the last one are for extragalactic calibrators,
            and the final one is for Solar System objects.  Recognized Solar
            System objects are: 

	       Planets: Venus*, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto**
	       
	       Moons: Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto
                   Saturn:  Titan <!-- Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione,  
		                     Hyperion, Iapetus, Phoebe, Janus, Epimetheus, Helene, 
                                  Telesto, Calypso, Atlas,Prometheus, Pandora, Pan -->
                   <!-- Uranus moons:  Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, Miranda, Cordelia,
                                  Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, 
                                  Rosalind, Belinda, Puck -->
                   Neptune: Triton 
                   <!-- Pluto moon:    Charon -->
	       
            Asteroids: Ceres, Pallas***, Vesta***, Juno***, Victoria***,
	               Davida***

            * Venus (and Jupiter and Earth, for that matter) is probably too
              resolved for most (sub)mm observations with interferometers.
              CASA has a disk-averaged Venus model for 0.303 to 350 GHz, but it
              may not capture the details of spectral lines (like day-night
              differences).

            ** Pluto alone.  No allowance is made for the possibility of Charon
              being in the field.  It is in the planet category for historical
              reasons.

            *** not recommended (The temperature is not yet adjusted for
                varying distance from the Sun.  The model data can be scaled
                after running setjy, but it is an involved process.)

	       The 'field' parameter must match the case of the field name(s)
	       in vis (as shown by listobs).

            Flux density calculation with Solar System objects depends on
            ephemerides.  setjy looks, in order, in
            '.',
            user.ephemerides.directory (a ~/.casarc option), and
            os.getenv('CASAPATH').split()[0] + '/data/ephemerides/JPL-Horizons'.

            If no ephemeris for the right object at the right time is
            present, the calculation will fail.  Ask the helpdesk to make an
            ephemeris.  The very adventurous and well versed in python can
            try it using CASA's recipes.ephemerides package:
	         import recipes.ephemerides as eph
		 help eph

            CASA comes with ephemerides for several more objects, but they
            are intended for use with me.framecomet(), and are not (yet)
            suitable flux density calibrators.  It is up to the observer to
            pick a good flux density calibrator (bright, spherical and
            featureless, on a circular orbit, in the right part of the sky,
            and not too resolved).  Even some of the objects listed above
            may prove to require more sophisticated flux density models than
            are currently implemented in CASA.  For many objects running
	       casalog.filter('INFO1') before running setjy will send more
	       information to the logger.  The cookbook also has an appendix
	       with descriptions of the models used by setjy (both
	       extragalactic and Solar System).

        usescratch  -- If True: he model visibility will be evaulated and saved on 
	disk in the MODEL_DATA column. This will increase your ms in size
