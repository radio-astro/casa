<example>

        The list of data sets given in the vis argument are concatenated into an output
        data set in concatvis.  If concatvis already exists (e.g., it is the same as the
        first input data set), then the other input data sets will be appended to the
        concatvis data set.  There is no limit to the number of input data sets.

	If none of the input data sets have any scratch columns (model and corrected columns),
        none are created in the concatvis.  Otherwise these columns are created on output
        and initialized to their default value (1 in model column, data in corrected column)
        for those data with no input columns.

        Spectral windows for each data set with the same chanelization, and within a specified
        frequency tolerance of another data set will be combined into one spectral window.

        A field position in one data set that is within a specified direction tolerance of
        another field position in any other data set will be combined into one field.  The
        field names need not be the same---only their position is used. 

        

	Keyword arguments:
	vis -- Name of input visibility files to be combined
		default: none; example: vis = 'mydata.ms',
                     vis=['src2.ms','ngc5921.ms','ngc315.ms']
	concatvis -- Name of visibility file that will contain the concatenated data
		note: if this file exits on disk then the input files are 
	              added to this file.  Otherwise the new file contains  
		      the concatenated data.  Be careful here when concatenating to
                      an existing file.
		default: none; example: concatvis='src2.ms'
		         example: concatvis='outvis.ms'

                other examples: 
                   concat(vis=['src2.ms','ngc5921.ms'], concatvis='src2.ms')
                       will concatenate 'ngc5921.ms' into 'src2.ms', and the original
		       src2.ms is lost

		   concat(vis=['src2.ms','ngc5921.ms'], concatvis='out.ms') 
                       will concatenate 'ngc5921.ms' and 'src2.ms' into a file named 
 	               'out.ms'; the original 'ngc5921.ms' and 'src2.ms' are untouched.

                   concat(vis=['v1.ms','v2.ms'], concatvis = 'vall.ms')
                      then
                   concat(vis=['v3.ms','v4.ms'], concatvis = 'vall.ms')
                     vall.ms will contains v1.ms+v2.ms+v3.ms+v4.ms
 
	     Note: run flagmanager to save flags in the concatvis

	freqtol -- Frequency shift tolerance for considering data to be in the same
                   spwid.  The number of channels must also be the same.
		default: ''  do not combine unless frequencies are equal
		example: freqtol='10MHz' will not combine spwid unless they are
		   within 10 MHz.
                Note: This option is useful to conbine spectral windows with very slight
                   frequency differences caused by Doppler tracking, for example.

	dirtol -- Direction shift tolerance for considering data as the same field
		default: '' means always combine.
		example: dirtol='1.arcsec' will not combine data for a field unless
		   their phase center differ by less than 1 arcsec.  If the field names
                   are different in the input data sets, the name in the output data
                   set will be the first relevant data set in the list.

	timesort -- If true, the output visibility table will be sorted in time.
	        default: false.  Data in order as read in.
		example: timesort=true
             Note: There is no constraint on data that is simultaneously observed for
                more than one field; for example multi-source correlation of VLBA data.
