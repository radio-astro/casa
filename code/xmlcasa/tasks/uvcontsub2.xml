<shortdescription>Continuum fitting and subtraction in the uv plane CALIBRATION VERSION</shortdescription>
<description>
With this task, the continuum emission is estimated from the 
spectral windows and channels selected by fitspw.  Currently,
only a constant continuum (fitorder=0) is supported; this will
be generalized in the near future.   The data may be averaged 
in time to increase the signal to noise for each continuum
estimate.  This fit represents a model of the continuum in 
all channels.

The fitted continuum spectrum is subtracted from all channels 
selected in spw, and the result (presumably only line emission)
is stored in the CORRECTED_DATA of a <em>new</em> MS (vis + ".contsub").
The selected CORRECTED_DATA column of vis is copied to the DATA
column of the new ms.

If want_cont is True, the continuum fit is placed in the DATA
column of a second new MS (vis + ".cont").  N.B. because the
continuum model is necessarily a smoothed fit, images made with
it are liable to have their field of view reduced in some
strange way, and if possible should be compared with images
made by excluding the line channels.  A copy of the continuum
estimate is always placed in the MODEL_DATA column of vis + ".cont"
regardless of want_cont.

	Continuum fitting and subtraction in the uv plane:
	
	With this task, the continuum emission is estimated from the 
        spectral windows and channels selected by fitspw.  Currently,
        only a constant continuum (fitorder=0) is supported; this will
        be generalized in the near future.   The data may be averaged 
        in time to increase the signal to noise for each continuum
        estimate.  This fit represents a model of the continuum in 
        all channels.
	
        The fitted continuum spectrum is subtracted from all channels 
        selected in spw, and the result (presumably only line emission)
        is stored in the CORRECTED_DATA of a <em>new</em> MS (vis + ".contsub").
        The selected CORRECTED_DATA column of vis is copied to the DATA
        column of the new ms.

        If want_cont is True, the continuum fit is placed in the DATA
        column of a second new MS (vis + '.cont').  N.B. because the
        continuum model is necessarily a smoothed fit, images made with
        it are liable to have their field of view reduced in some
        strange way, and if possible should be compared with images
        made by excluding the line channels.  A copy of the continuum
        estimate is always placed in the MODEL_DATA column of vis + '.cont'
        regardless of want_cont.


        The input MeasurementSet should have calibrated data in
        its CORRECTED_DATA column.

	Keyword arguments:
	vis -- Name of input visibility file
		default: none; example: vis='ngc5921.ms'
        field -- Field selection for continuum estimation, subtraction, and
                (if splitdata=True) split
                default: field = '' means select all fields
                field = 1 # will get field_id=1 (if you give it an 
                        integer, it will retrieve the source with that index.
                field = '1328+307'  specifies source '1328+307'
		field = '13*' will retrieve '1328+307' and any other fields
		   beginning with '13'
	fitspw -- Selection of spectral windows and channels to use in the
	          fit for the continuum, using general spw syntax
		default: (all); example: fitspw='0:5~30;40~55'
        combine -- Data axes to combine for the continuum estimate
                default: '' --> solutions will break at scan, field, and spw
                      boundaries according to solint
              Options: '','spw'','scan',field', or any comma-separated combination
              example: combine='spw'  --> form spw-averaged continuum estimate
	solint -- Timescale for per-baseline fit (units optional)
		default: 'int' --&gt; no averaging, fit every integration;
		example: solint='10s'  --&gt; average to 10s before fitting
                         10 or '10' --&gt; '10s' (unitless: assumes seconds)
                options: 'int' --&gt; per integration
                         'inf' --&gt; per scan
	fitorder -- Polynomial order for the fit of the continuum
		default: 0 (constant); example: fitorder=1
	spw -- Optional per spectral window selection of channels from
	       which to subtract the continuum. 
		default: spw='', means subtract from all channels for
		  each spw that had a continuum estimated
	       Also, this specifies which spw/chan will be split
	       out if splitdata=True.
	want_cont -- Create vis + '.cont' to hold the continuum estimate.
		default: 'False'; example: want_cont=True
		The continuum estimate will be placed in: vis.cont
        async -- Run task in a separate process (return CASA prompt)
                default: False; example: async=True
