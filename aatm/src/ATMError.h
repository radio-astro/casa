/** \page testError Example showing how to use the class Error

 \dontinclude testError.cpp

 The codes using the Error class must include its header file.
 \skip include
 \until using

 To illustrate how to use this class we take here an example defining a class Array with a constraint
 about a maximum index.
 \skip const
 \until testbed

 In the test program we begin by showing the default critical limit for acceptable errors:
 \skip main()
 \until default

 An array is declared and it is populated by integers for indices from 0 to 100. The opperator []
 generate an Error throwing it if the index exceeds the maximum allowed limit, we insert the loop in a try
 section. When the index j exceeds the upper limit in the indexing, an Error is thrown unless
 this type type of errors is acceptable.
 \skip Array
 \until Error

 The out-of-range indexing in the [] operator methods having been declared to be SERIOUS, when j
 exceeds the maximum size allowed, its severity, SERIOUS (see the method []) is just at the critical
 when the error become unacceptable. Hence an Error exception is thrown.
 \skip getLevel
 \until input!

 The execution proceeds; the following test attests that this error was considered as acceptable:
 \skip if(Error
 \until proceed

 We now repeat this scenario triggering with the same error but before that we  test with a tolerence
 which is more constraining: any error will be thrown only when it severity reach the FATAL limit:
 \from setAcceptableLevel
 \until cout

 The scenario is now repeated:
 \skip Test:
 \until return

 The Error is not catched because with this new contextthe error which is still SERIOUS is considered
 as acceptable.
