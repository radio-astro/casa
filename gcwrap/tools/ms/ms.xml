  The ms tool provides functions to manipulate the contents of
  measurement set tables.
  The functions can be categorised as shown below.

<!--
  It is easy to get an ms tool and a measurement set table
  confused. The table is the disk files that contain your data. The
  tool is a process on your computer that provides functions that
  allow you access the data in the table. One tool can access only one
  table at any time. If you want to access two measurement sets
  simultaneously you need to create two ms \tools.

  The ms tool is frequently used as a server of data for
  higher-level \tools\ such as <link anchor="visplot:visplot">visplot</link>.
-->


  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Attaching to a Measurement Set}

    <!-- A ms tool is usually associated with a measurement set
    table.-->

    The simplest and most common way to attach an ms tool to a
    measurement set is to use the <link
    anchor="ms:ms.open">ms.open</link> function which requires that
    you specify the name of the measurement set table.

    The function <link anchor="ms:ms.fromfits">ms.fromfits</link>
    converts a \uvfits\ file to a measurement set table prior to
    attaching the ms tool to the newly created measurement set.
    <!-- , and the
    <link anchor="ms:ms.sdfitstoms.constructor">sdfitstoms</link> constructor,
    which reads a single dish \fits\ file. --> The conversion step may
    take some time if the \fits\ file is large. However it only needs
    to be done once. The measurement set table is not deleted when you
    close the ms tool, using the close function, or exit \casa. And
    once the measurement set table is created it is much faster to
    attach an ms tool to it using the <link anchor="ms:ms.open">ms.open</link>
    function.

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Getting summary information}

    The summary function will display, in the logger, an overview of
    the measurement set. This will include listings of the fields,
    spectral windows \&amp; polarization setups used in the measurement
    set.

    The <link anchor="ms:ms.range.function">range</link> function will provide more
    quantitative information on the minimum, maximum or used values of
    specified parameters.  When using this function you may need to do
    an initial selection, as described below, depending on whether the
    parameters you ask for change their shape.  A list of parameters
    accepted by the <link anchor="ms:ms.range.function">range</link> function is given in
    table~\ref{ms:tblItems} and this table also indicates when an
    initial selection is necessary.

    The lister function provides a concise listing of the data in 
    the measurement set.

    The listhistory function lists the contents of the measurement set
    history table.  The history table contains a record of changes
    made to the measurement set by flagger, calibrater, imager and
    other tools.

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Selecting data}

    As described in the <link anchor="ms">ms module</link> documentation a
    measurement set can contain data with a variety of different
    shapes. Some of the functions in this tool require the data to
    be in a fixed shape. Before you can use these functions you need
    to select a subset of the data in the measurement set where all
    the data has a fixed shape.  There are two functions which can be
    used to do this. These are the
    <link anchor="ms:ms.selectinit.function">selectinit</link> and
    <link anchor="ms:ms.command.function">command</link> functions. 

    The select function can be used to further refine which subset of
    the data will be used by the data access functions. This function
    allows you to select specific rows in a measurement set using a
    wide range of criteria.

    The select function can only select whole rows in a measurement
    set. To select specific channels within a row you use the
    selectchannel function.  Similarly to select specific
    polarizations you should use the selectpolarization function.

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Reading and writing data}

    The getdata function is used to read data from the measurement set
    into casapy variables. You can select which columns of the
    measurement set main table you are interested in and only the
    subset of data specified using the selection functions described
    above will be retreived. Any frequency averaging (see the
    selectfrequency function) and polarization conversion (see the
    selectpolarization function) will be done when you retreive the
    data. The full power of casapy and other \casa\ tasks and tools, like
    plotxy, can then be used for adhoc inspection and calculations
    involving the data.

    If the measurement set was opened for writing then the putdata
    function can be used to write the data back into the measurement
    set. When writing data back into the measurement set you cannot
    change the data shape or the coordinates of the data, only the
    numerical values. This means that you cannot write data that has
    been averaged in frequency or converted to different
    polarizations.

    When using the getdata function with a large measurement set you
    need to be careful to not request too much data. The measurement
    set is stored on disk but casapy variables are stored in
    memory. To allow you to access large amounts of data in an ordered
    way the ms tool provides functions that allow you to iterate through
    the data in a convienient way. 

   If you need to step through the data in an orderly fashion, you
   can use the iteration functions.  These allow you to set up an
   iteration order (<link anchor="ms:ms.iterinit.function">iterinit</link>), obtain the
   first iteration (<link anchor="ms:ms.iterorigin.function">iterorigin</link>), go to the
   next iteration (<link anchor="ms:ms.iternext.function">iternext</link>) and end the
   iteration prematurely (<link anchor="ms:ms.iterend.function">iterend</link>).  The
   <link anchor="ms:ms.iterorigin.function">iterorigin</link> and
   <link anchor="ms:ms.iternext.function">iternext</link> function set the currently
   selected table (as used by <link anchor="ms:ms.getdata.function">getdata</link> and
   others) to the current iteration.  At the end of the iteration,
   the original selection is restored.

   You can iterate through a measurement set you have previously selected
   using <link anchor="ms:ms.select.function">select</link>, but if you
   use <link anchor="ms:ms.select.function">select</link> while iterating, you
   cannot get back the unselected iteration (without reiterating through the
   table until the current point).

   The writehistory function allows messages to be appended to the measurement
   set history table should you wish to do so.  The listhistory function lists
   your messages and those created by flagger, calibrater, imager and other
   tools.

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Conversions to \fits}

    Just as the fromfits function will convert a \uvfits\ file to a measurement
    set the tofits function will convert a measurement set to a \uvfits\
    file. Similarly a single dish measurement set ie., one with a FLOAT\_DATA
    column rather than a DATA column, can be converted to a single dish \fits\
    file using the tosdfits function.

    You cannot read a \uvfits\ file into a measurement set and write it
    out as a single dish \fits\ file or vice-versa.

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Concatenation}

    The concatenate function can be used to append the data from one
    measurement set to the end of another. As all the data is copied this
    function may take some time if the measurement set to be copied is
    large. The measurement set needs to be opened for writing for this to work.

    The virtconcatenate function enables virtual concatenation, i.e. the
    data is not rewritten but just reindexed such that the two input MSs have
    the same subtables. They can then be turned into a multi-MS.

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Sorting the main table by time}

    The timesort function permits you to sort the MS main table by time in
    ascending order. This can be useful after a concatenation. 
    
  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Sorting the main table by a custom set of columns}

    The sort function permits you to sort the MS main table by a custom
    set of columns in ascending order. This can be useful to compare tables
    generated in different ways (e.g.: cvel and mastransform)
   

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Splitting}
    The split function allows you to make a new ms from a subset of the 
    actual ms.
		

  \medskip\noindent\textbf{Flagging data}

    The flag and buffer functions all belong together.  The idea is to fill a
    buffer of data
    (<link anchor="ms:ms.fillbuffer.function">fillbuffer</link>), optionally
    retrieve it as a record
    (<link anchor="ms:ms.getbuffer.function">getbuffer</link>) and display it
    in some data display tool, do operations like differencing
    (<link anchor="ms:ms.diffbuffer.function">diffbuffer</link>), clipping
    (<link anchor="ms:ms.clipbuffer.function">clipbuffer</link>) and manual
    edits of the displayed data
    (<link anchor="ms:ms.setbufferflags.function">setbufferflags</link>), and
    then write the flags back to the MS
    (<link anchor="ms:ms.writebufferflags.function">writebufferflags</link>),
    into the appropriate flag level, so you can choose to apply or undo them.
    The data is untouched by these functions.

rec=ms.getdata(["weight","data"])
# modify rec['weight'] and rec['data'] values as desired
ms.putdata(rec)
ms.close()
	\end{verbatim}


We open the MS for writing, select an array and spectral window
and then select a few antennas and a uv range. We then get out
the weight values and the data. We change these
values in casapy and then write them back to the measurement
set. Finally, we close the ms, causing the values to be written
back to disk.  <!-- Note: you cannot use the name ms as a casapy
variable (e.g., ms=ms("MyMS")), because that would overwrite
the ms definition itself. -->

  <description>
    This is the most commonly used constructor. It creates an ms tool
    which is attached to the specified measurement set table.

    By default the table is opened read only to prevent you from
    accidently making changes to the measurement set. Set nomodify to
    False you you do intend to make changes.

    Setting the lock argument to True will permanently lock the table
    preventing other processes from writing to the measurement
    set. Unless you expect this to happen, and want to prevent it, you
    should leave the lock argument at the default value which implies
    auto-locking.

    The host argument specifies which machine the precompiled ms
    process should be started on. The default value starts it on the
    same machine as the one that casapy is running on. 

    In order to run the ms tool on a remote machine you need to
    satisfy all the following conditions.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It must be possible to start \casa\ on the remote machine
    \item You must be able to log onto the remote machine without
          having to type a password
    \item The CASAPATH environment variable must be defined on the
          remote machine. You may want to set this up in the relevant
          ``dot'' file eg., adding a line like 
          \texttt{source~/usr/local/aips++/aipsinit.csh} in your 
          .cshrc file (for csh).
    \end{itemize}
    One quick way to check if all three conditions are met is to type, 
    on your local machine \texttt{rsh host 'echo \$CASAPATH'}
    where host is replaced by the name of the remote machine. If the
    value of the CASAPATH variable that is printed does not contain
    something like \texttt{aips-root~architecture~site~host} and that
    all the values are correct for the remote machine you can be
    certain that starting the ms tool, or any \casa\ server, on the
    remote host will not work

    Each ms tool can only run one function at a time. To solve this
    you start two servers. The forcenewserver argument allows you to
    do this by overriding the default behaviour of having each ms tool
    share the same server.
 
    This function returns an ms tool or fail if something went wrong,
    like an error in the measurement set name.

    This function will convert a \uvfits\ file to a measurement set table and
    then open the measurement set table. The newly created measurement set
    table will continue to exist after the tool has been closed.

    Setting the lock argument to True will permanently lock the table
    preventing other processes from writing to the measurement set. Unless you
    expect this to happen, and want to prevent it, you should leave the lock
    argument at the default value which implies auto-locking.

<!--
    The host argument \tt{(currently ignored)} specifies which machine the
    precompiled ms process should be started on. The default value starts it on
    the same machine as the one that casapy is running on.

    In order to run the ms tool on a remote machine you need to
    satisfy all the following conditions.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It must be possible to start \casa\ on the remote machine
    \item You must be able to log onto the remote machine without
          having to type a password
    \item The CASAPATH environment variable must be defined on the
          remote machine. You may want to set this up in the relevant
          ``dot'' file eg., adding a line like 
          \texttt{source~/usr/local/aips++/aipsinit.csh} in your 
          .cshrc file (for csh).
    \end{itemize}
    One quick way to check if all three conditions are met is to type, 
    on your local machine \texttt{rsh host 'echo \$CASAPATH'}
    where host is replaced by the name of the remote machine. If the
    value of the CASAPATH variable that is printed does not contain
    something like \texttt{aips-root~architecture~site~host} and that
    all the values are correct for the remote machine you can be
    certain that starting the ms tool, or any \casa\ server, on the
    remote host will not work

    Each ms tool can only run one function at a time. To solve this
    you start two servers. The forcenewserver argument allows you to
    do this by overriding the default behaviour of having each ms tool

    Note that the variety of fits files that fromfits is able to
    interpret correctly is limited mostly to files similar to those
    produced by classic AIPS. In particular, it understands only binary
    table extensions for the antenna (AN), frequency (FQ) and source
    (SU) information and ignores other extensions.

    This function returns True if it successfully attachs the ms tool
    to a newly created Measurement Set or False if something went
    wrong, like an error in a file name.

    !!!NOT IMPLEMENTED!!!
    Make a new measurement set table and a new ms \tool, from a subset
    of the data in the measurement set the current ms tool is
    attached to. The subset is selected using the qualification part
    of the table command as described in 
    \htmladdnormallink{note 199}{../../notes/199/199.html}.  This
    function will return a new ms \tool. 

    To use this function successfully it helps to have an
    understanding of the column names used in a measurement set
    table. These are described in 
    \htmladdnormallink{note 229}{../../notes/229/229.html}.

-->     <!-- Any
    identifiers that are used to refer to rows in a subtable will be
    zero based ie., the first row is row zero and not row one. This is
    different to the convention used throught casapy and in other parts
    of this tool. The example below illustrates this. --> <!--

    The new measurement set must be given a name but it is not written
    to disk until the <link anchor="ms:ms.close.function">close</link> or
    <link anchor="ms:ms.done.function">done</link> functions are performed by the
    associated tool.

    The resulting measurement set is always a reference to the
    original measurement set, therefore you should not delete the
    original measurement set from disk unless you also intend to
    delete the selected one. However the converse is not True, you
    may delete the selected measurement set and keep the original one.
  </description>
  <example>
    
      NOT IMPLEMENTED!!!
      ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
      subms = ms.command('3C273XC1-dd1.ms', 'DATA_DESC_ID == 0')
      print 'The original ms has', ms.nrow(), 'rows.'
      print 'The selected one has', subms.nrow(), 'rows.'
      subms.close()
    
    In this example a new ms \tool, called subms, is created that
    accesses a newly created measurement set called
    \verb|3C273XC1-dd1.ms|. The new tool provides access only to the
    data where the value in the \verb|DATA_DESC_ID| column is
    zero. 

    This is equivalent to using the <link
    anchor="ms:ms.selectinit.function">selectinit</link> function with
    an argument of zero.--> <!-- This difference in indexing value, between the
    command and the selectinit functions is illustrative of the
    difference between zero and one based indexing.--> <!--

    If the measurement set you are using contains data with different
    spectral windows or polarization setups, then the selected
    measurement set will have less rows than the original measurement
    set.
  </example>
  <example>
    
      NOT IMPLEMENTED
      ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
      subms = ms.command('3C273XC1-a12.ms', 
                         'ANTENNA1 == 0 &amp;&amp; ANTENNA2 == 1')
      print 'The original ms has', ms.nrow(), 'rows.'
      print 'The selected one has', subms.nrow(), 'rows.'
      subms.close()
    
    This is identical to the previous example except that a more
    complex command has been used. In this case all the data from one
    baseline are selected. The baseline chosen corresponds to data
    collected from the antennas defined in the first and second rows
    of the antenna sub-table of the measurement set.

    This example selects all the auto-correlations in the measurement
    set. The resultant ms tool will allow you to modify the
    data. Because the selected measurement set references the data in
    the original measurement set modifying the data in the selected
    measurement set will also change the auto-correlations in original
    measurement set.

  <description>
    This function writes a \uvfits\ file that contains the data in
    the measurement set associated with this tool. The \fits\ file is
    always written in floating point format and the data are always
    stored in the primary array of the \fits\ file.

    If the measurement set has been imaged or calibrated in CASA, it
    may contain additional data columns. You need to select ONE of
    these columns to be written to the \fits\ file. The possible
    options are:
    \begin{description}
      \item[observed] This is the raw data as collected by the
                      telescope. All interferometric measurement sets must
                      contain this column. A synonym for 'observed' is
                      'data'.
      \item[corrected] This is the calibrated data. A synonym for
                       'corrected' is 'corrected\_data'.
      \item[model] This is the visibilites that would be measured using
                   the current model of the sky. A synonym for
                   'model' is 'model\_data'.
    \end{description}
    The parsing of these strings is case insensitive. If any other
    option is specified then the observed data will be written.

    By default a single-source \uvfits\ file is written, but if the
    measurement set contains more than one field or if you set the
    multisource argument to True a multi-source \uvfits\ file will be
    written. Because of limitations in the \uvfits\ format you have to
    ensure that the data shape is fixed for all the data you intend to
    write to one \fits\ file. See the general description of this tool
    for how you can select data to meet this condition.

    The combinespw argument is used to control whether data from
    different spectral windows will be written as different entries in
    the \fits\ FQ (frequency) table or combined as different IF's
    within one entry in the FQ table. You should normally only set
    this to True if you know that the data from different spectral
    windows were observed simultaneously, and the data in the
    measurement set can be equally divided between all the spectral
    windows (i.e.\ each window should have the same width).  Use of
    this switch is recommended for data to be processed in classic
    AIPS and difmap (if possible, e.g., standard dual IF observations).

    The padwithflags argument is only relevant if combinespw is True.
    If true, it will fill in data that is 'missing' with flags to fit
    the IF structure.  This is appropriate if the MS had a few
    frequency-dependent flags applied, and was then time-averaged by
    split.  If the spectral windows were observed at different times,
    padwithflags=True will add a large number of flags, making the 
    output file significantly longer.  It does not yet support spectral
    windows with different widths.

    The \fits\ GC (gain curve) and TY (system temperature) tables can
    be optionally written by setting the writesyscal argument to True.
    This is a rather WSRT-specific operation at the moment and may not
    work correctly for measurement sets from other telescopes.

    The width argument is for channel averaging while outputing the 
    data to the fits file. The default values of 1 will copy the 
    channels of the input as is. The start channel number is the 
    first channel of the spw expression. The number of output channels
    is determined by spw expression and the width. The width is the 
    number of channels of the input data to make 1 channel of the output data.

  <example>
    
      
      ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
      ms.tofits('3C273XC1.fits', column='DATA'); 
      ms.done()
    
     This example writes  the observed data of a measurement set to a 
     \uvfits\ file.

      
      ms.open('big.ms')
      ms.tofits('part.fits', column='CORRECTED', field=[0,1], spw=[2]); 
      ms.done()
    
     This example writes part (the first 2 fields and the third spectral 
     window) of the corrected data to the fits file.

    much information is displayed.

    For especially large datasets, the cachesize parameter can be increased for possibly better
    performance.

    This method can also return, in the header argument, a record
    containing the following fields.
    \begin{description}

    DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHM TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF UNFLAGGED ROWS
    The number of unflagged rows will only be computed if listunflis True.
    The number of unflagged rows (the nUnflRows columns in the scans and fields portions of the listing) is
    calculated by summing the fractional unflagged bandwidth for each row (and hence why the number of unflagged
    rows, in general, is not an integer). Thus a row which has half of its
    total bandwidth flagged contributes 0.5 rows to the unflagged row count. A row with 20 of 32 channels of
    homogeneous width contributes 20/32 = 0.625 rows to the unflagged row count. A row with a value of False
    in the FLAG\_ROW column is not counted in the number of unflagged rows.
  </description>
  <example>
    
      
      ms.open('3C273XC1.MS')
      outr=ms.summary(verbose=True)
      ###print the begining of observation in this ms

      ###print  a dictionary of the info of scan 1

  <description>
    This function will return the range of values in the currently
    selected measurement set for the items specified.  Possible items
    include most scalar columns, interferometer number
    (1000*antenna1+antenna2), uvdist(ance), u, v, w, amplitude, phase,
    real and imaginary components of the data (and corrected and model
    versions of these - if these columns are present). See the table
    at the top of the document to find the exact list.

    You specify items in which you are interested using a string
    vector where each element is a case insensitive item name.  This
    function will then return a record that has fields corresponding
    to each of the specified items. Each field will contain the range
    of the specified item. For many items the range will be the
    minimum and maximum values but for some it will be a list of
    unique values. Unrecognized items are ignored.
    
    By default the FLAG column is used to exclude flagged data before
    any ranges are determined, but you can set useflags=False to include
    flagged data in the range.  However, if you average in frequency, 
    flagging will still be applied.

    You can influence the memory use and the reading speed using 
    the blocksize argument - it specifies how big a block of data
    to read at once (in MB). For large datasets on machines with lots
    of memory you may speed things up by setting this higher than the
    default (10 MB).

    For some items, as indicated with an \S\ in table
    \ref{ms:tblItems} (in the general description of this tool), you
    need to call selectinit to select a portion of the data with a
    unique shape prior to calling this function.

    Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or
    obs\_residual and the imaging\_weight item are not available unless
    your measurement set has been processed either with the imager or
    calibrator tools.
  </description>
  <example>
    
      
      ms.open("3C273XC1.MS")
      ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
      ms.range(["time","uvdist","amplitude","antenna1"])
#{'amplitude': array([  2.60339398e-02,   3.38518333e+01]),
# 'antenna1': array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 11, 12, 13,
#                    14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]),
# 'time': array([  4.12162940e+09,   4.12164267e+09]),
# 'uvdist': array([   46.26912101,  3727.97385983])}
    
    In this example the minimum and maximum observation times,
    uvdistances, data amplitudes are returned as well as a list of all the
    antennas in the antenna1 column. <!-- Note that the double quoted
    string produces a string vector as the input argument. -->

    For this dataset the selectinit function did not need to be
    called as all the data is of one shape.

This tool lists measurement set visibility data under a number of
input selection conditions.  The measurement set data columns that
can be listed are: the raw data, corrected data, model data, and
residual (corrected - model) data.

The output table format is dynamic.  Field, Spectral Window, and
Channel columns are not displayed if the column contents are uniform.
For example, if ``spw = `1' '' is specified, the spw column will not be
displayed.  When a column is not displayed, a message is sent to the
logger and terminal indicating that the column values are uniform and
listing the uniform value.

Table column descriptions:

  <description>
    A measurement set can contain data with a variety of different
    shapes (as described in the overall description to this tool).  To
    allow functions to return data in fixed shape arrays you need to
    select, using this function, rows that contain the same data
    shape. You do not need to use this function if all the data in
    your measurement set has only one shape.

    The DATA\_DESC\_ID column in the measurement set contains a
    value that maps to a particular row in the POLARIZATION and
    SPECTRAL\_WINDOW subtables. Hence all rows with the same
    value in the DATA\_DESC\_ID column must have the same data
    shape. To select all the data where the DATA\_DESC\_ID value
    is $N$ you call this function with the datadescid argument set to
    $N$. <!-- The examples below make this a bit clearer.-->

    It is possible to have a measurement set with differing values in
    the DATA\_DESC\_ID column but where all the data is a fixed
    shape. For example this will occur if the reference frequency
    changes but the number of spectral channels is fixed. In cases
    like this all the data can be selected, using this function with
    an argument of zero.  If the data shape does change and you call
    this function with an datadescid set to zero <!-- it is equivalent to
    calling this function with datadescid set to one. When this
    happens --> the return value will be False. In all other cases it will be
    True.

    To return to the completely unselected measurement set, set the
    reset argument to True. This will allow you to access the full
    range of rows in the measurement set, rather than just the
    selected measurement set.

    The datadescid must always be a non-negative integer.
  </description>
  <example>
    
      ms.open("3C273XC1.MS")
      ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
      print ms.range(["uvdist"])
      ms.selectinit(reset=True)
      print ms.range("uvdist")
    

    In this example we display the range of uv distances for the data
    in the specified measurement set. The first print statement will
    only use data where the DATA\_DESC\_ID column is 0. This will
    correspond to a specific spectral window and polarization
    setup. The second print statement will print the range of uv
    distances for all the data in the measurement set (which is the
    same in this case).

    This function will select a subset of the current measurement set
    based on the range of values for each field in the input
    record. The range function will return a record that can be
    altered and used as the argument for this function.  A successful
    selection returns True. Allowable fields are tabulated in
    table~\ref{ms:tblItems} (in the general description of this
    tool). Unrecognized fields are ignored.

    You need to call <link anchor="ms:ms.selectinit.function">selectinit</link> before
    calling this function. If you haven't then selectinit will be
    called for you with default arguments.

    Repeated use of this function, with different arguments, will
    further refine the selection, resulting in a successively smaller
    selected measurement set. If the selected measurement set does not
    contain any rows then this function will return False and send a
    warning message in the logger. Otherwise this function will return
    True. To undo all the selections you need to use the selectinit
    function (with reset=True).

      ms.select(items=rec)
    
    This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
    the value in the DATA\_DESC\_ID column is zero. This
    corresponds to a particular spectral window and polarization
    setup. It then selects all the data where the first antenna in the
    interferometer is number one, three or five and where the uv
    distance is between 1200 and 1900 meters.  Finally it selects all
    the data which was observed between 4121629420 seconds and
    4121638290 seconds (since zero hours on the day where the modified
    Julian day is zero). Since this time in seconds is quite obscure I
    have also illustrated how to use the quanta tool to convert a
    date/time string into seconds which can then be used to perform
    the same time selection.

    The selections are cumulative so that at the end of this example
    only data in the specified time range, with the specified,
    interferometers, uv distances, spectral window and polarization
    setup are selected.

    setup. It then selects all the data where the first antenna in the
    interferometer is number zero, two or four and where the uv
    distance is between 1200 and 1900 meters.  Finally it uses a query
    to select all the data for which the ANTENNA1 column is 2 (this
    selects the middle antenna of the previous, zero-based, selection).
    The selections are cumulative so that at the end of this example
    only data in the specified time range, with the specified,
    interferometers, uv distances, spectral window and polarization
    setup are selected.

  <description>
    This function allows you to select a subset of the frequency
    channels in the current measurement set.  This function can also
    average, over frequency channels, prior to providing the values to
    the user.

    Selection on channels is not allowed using either the select or
    command functions as they can only select entire rows in a
    measurement set. Channel selection involves accessing only some of
    the values in a row. Like all the selection functions this
    function does not change the current measurement but updates the
    measurement set selection parameters so that functions like
    getdata will return the desired subset of the data.  Repeated use
    of this function will overwrite any previous channel
    selection.

    There are four parameters, the number of output channels, the
    first input channel to use, the number of input channels to
    average into one output channel, and the increment in the input
    spectrum for the next output channel. All four parameters need to
    be specified. 

    This function return True if the selection was successful, and False if
    not. In the latter case an error message will also be sent to the
    logger.

    You need to call <link anchor="ms:ms.selectinit.function">selectinit</link> before
    calling this function. If you haven't then selectinit will be
    called for you with default arguments.

    This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
    the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This

    setup. It then selects on frequency channels to produce 3 output
    channels, the first output channel is the average of channels
    2,3,4,5,6 in the input, the second output channel is the average
    of channel 5,6,7,8,9 and the third is the average of channels

    This function allows you to select a subset of the polarizations

    You specify the polarizations using a string vector. Allowable
    strings are include I, Q, U, V, RR, RL, LR, LL, XX, YY, XY,
    YX. These string must be specified in upper case. If the
    polarizations match those present in the measurement set they will
    be selected directly, otherwise all polarizations are read and
    then a conversion step is done. If the conversion cannot be done
    then an error will be produced when you try to access the data.

    This function return True if the selection was successful, and False if

  <description>
  This function permits you to transform the spectral data of your measurement set to a 
  given reference frame. The present reference frame information in the MS is examined and 
  the transformation performed accordingly. Since all such transformations are linear in 
  frequency, a pure change of reference frame only affects the channel boundary definitions.

  In addition, the function permits you to permanently regrid the data, i.e. reduce the 
  channel number and/or move the boundaries using several interpolation methods (selected 
  using parameter "interpolation"). The new channels are equidistant in frequency 
  (if parameter "mode" is chosen to be vrad or freq, or equidistant in
  wavelength if  parameter "mode" is chosen to be vopt or wave).
  If "mode" is chosen to be "chan", the regridding is performed by combining
  the existing channels, i.e. not moving but just eliminating channel boundaries where
  necessary.

  The regridding is applied to the channel definition and all data of the MS, i.e. all 
  columns which contain arrays whose dimensions depend on the number of channels. 
  The input parameters are verified before any modification is made to the MS.

  The target reference frame can be set by providing the name of a standard reference 
  frame (LSRK, LSRD, BARY, GALACTO, LGROUP, CMB, TOPO, GEO, or SOURCE, default = no change of 
  frame) in parameter "outframe".
  For each field in the MS, the channel frequencies are transformed from their present 
  reference frame to the one given by parameter "outframe".

  If the regridding parameters are set, they are interpreted in the "outframe" reference
  frame. The regridding is applied to the data after the reference frame transformation.

  <example>
    
      ms.fromfits("NGC5921.MS", "/usr/lib/casapy/data/demo/NGC5921.fits")
      ms.regridspw(outframe="LSRK")
    
    This example reads a measurement set and transforms its spectral axis to
    the LSRK reference frame.
    
      ms.regridspw(outframe="BARY", mode="vrad", 
      center=73961800., chanwidth=50., bandwidth=1000.,
      restfreq=1420405750e6)
    
    In this example, all spectral windows in the MS will be transformed 
    to the BARY reference frame and then be regridded such that the center of the 
    new spectral window is at radio velocity = 73961800. m/s (BARY). If the bandwidth 
    of the observation is large enough the total width of the spectral window will
    be 1000 m/s, i.e. 20 channels of width 50 m/s, 10 on each side of the given
    center.
    
      ms.regridspw(mode="vopt", restfreq=1420405750e6)
    
    In this example the channels are regridded such that they are
    equidistant in optical velocity. The reference frame and number of channels 
    is kept as is.
    
      ms.regridspw(mode="chan", center=64, chanwidth=2,
      bandwidth=102)
    
    In this example, the channels are regridded such that the new bandwidth is
    102 of the original channels centered on the original channel 64, and the new
    channels are twice as wide as the original channels.

  </returns>

  <description>
    This function will read the specified items from the currently
    selected measurement set and returns them in fields of a record.
    The main difference between this and direct access of the table,
    using the table tool, is that this function reads data from the
    \emph{selected} measurement set, it provides access to derived
    quantities like amplitude \&amp; flag\_sum and it can reorder the
    data.

    The items to read are specified, as with the range function, using
    a vector of strings. Table~\ref{ms:tblItems} shows the allowable
    items. Unrecognized items will result in a warning being sent to
    the logger.  Duplicate items are silently ignored.

    The record that is returned contains fields that correspond to
    each of the specified items. Most fields will contain an
    array. The array may be one, two or three dimensional depending on
    whether the corresponding row in the measurement set is a scalar,
    one or two dimensional. Unless the ifraxis argument is set to T
    the length of the last axis on these arrays will correspond to the
    number of rows in the selected measurement set.

    If the ifraxis argument is set to True, the row axis is split into an
    interferometer axis and a time axis. For example a measurement set
    with 90 rows, in an array with 6 telescopes (so that there are 15
    interferometers), may have a data array of shape \verb|[4,32,90]|
    if ifraxis is False or \verb|[4,32,15,6]|, if ifraxis is True (assuming
    there are 4 correlations and 32 channels). If there are missing
    rows as will happen if not all interferometers where used for all
    time-slots then a default value will be inserted.
    
    This splitting of the row axis may not happen for items where
    there is only a single value per row. For some items the returned
    vector will contain only as many values as there are
    interferometers and it is implicit that the same value should be
    used for all time slots. The antenna1, antenna2, feed1, feed2 \&amp;
    ifr\_number items fall in this category. For other items the
    returned vector will have as many values as there are time slots
    and it is implicit that the same value should be used for all
    interefometers. The field\_id, scan\_number, data\_desc\_id \&amp;
    time items fall into this category.

    The axis\_info item provides data labelling information. It
    returns a record with the following fields: corr\_axis,
    freq\_axis, ifr\_axis \&amp; time\_axis. The latter two fields are not
    present if ifr\_axis is set to False. The corr\_axis field contains a
    string vector with elements like 'RR' or 'XY' that indicates which
    polarizations where correlated together to produce the data. The
    length of this vector will always be the same as the length of the
    first axis of the data array. The freq\_axis field contains a
    record with two fields, chan\_freq \&amp; resolution. Each of these
    fields contains vectors which indicate the centre frequency and
    spectral resolution (FWHM) of each channel. The length of these
    vectors will be the same as the length of the second axis in the
    data. The ifr\_axis field contains fields: ifr\_number,
    ifr\_name, ifr\_shortname \&amp; baseline. The ifr\_number is the same
    as returned by the ifr\_item, the ifr\_name \&amp; ifr\_shortname are
    string vecors containing descriptions of the interferometer and
    the baseline is the Euclidian distance, in meters between the two
    antennas. All of these vectors have a length equal to the number
    of interferometers in the selected measurement set ie., to the
    length of the third axis in the data when ifraxis is True. The
    time\_axis field contains the MJD seconds field and optionally the
    HA, UT \&amp; LAST fields. To include the optional fields you need to
    add the ha, last or ut strings to the list of requested items. All
    the fields in the time\_axis record contain vectors that indicate
    the time at the midpoint of the observation and are in
    seconds. The MJD seconds field is since 0 hours on the day having a
    modified julian day number of zero and the rest are since midnight
    prior to the start of the observation.

    An optional gap size can be specified to visually separate groups of 
    interferometers with the same antenna1 index (handy for
    identifying antennas in an interferometer vs time display). The
    default is no gap.

    An optional increment can be specified to return data from every
    row matching the increment only.

    When the average flag is set, the data will be averaged over the
    time axis if the ifraxis is True or the row axis i.e., different
    interferometers and times may be averaged together. In the latter
    case, some of the coordinate information, like antenna\_id, will
    no longer make sense.

    calling this function. If you haven't then selectinit will be

    This example selects all the data from the
    measurement set where the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is
    zero. This corresponds to a particular spectral window and
    polarization setup. It then gets the correlated amplitude, and the
    axis information from this selected measurement set. This is
    returned in the casapy variable d. The remainder of the example
    prints a table of 'hour angle' and corresponding 'correlated
    amplitude' for the first channel, correlation and baseline.

    This function allows you to write values from casapy variables back
    into the measurement set table. The main difference between this
    and directly accessing the table using the table tool is that this
    function writes data to the \emph{selected} measurement set.

    Unlike the getdata function you can only put items that correspond
    to actual table columns. You cannot change the data shape either
    so that the number of correlations, channels and rows (or
    intereferometers/time slots) must match the values in the selected
    measurement set. If the values were obtained using the getdata
    function with ifraxis argument set to True, then any default values
    added to fill in missing intereferometer/timeslots pairs will be
    ignored when writing the modified values back using this function.

    The measurement set has to be opened for read/write access to be
    able to use this function.

    You need to call <link anchor="ms:ms.selectinit.function">selectinit</link> before
    calling this function. If you haven't then selectinit will be
    called for you with default arguments.

  <example>
    
      
      ms.open("3C273XC1.MS", nomodify=False)
      ms.selectinit(datadescid=0)
      rec = ms.getdata(["weight","data"])
      rec['weight'][:,:] = 1
      import Numeric
      meanrec = Numeric.average(rec['data'],axis=None)
      print "Mean data value = ", meanrec
      rec['data'][:,:,:] -= meanrec
      ms.putdata(rec)
    
    This example selects all the data from the measurement set where
    the value in the DATA_DESC_ID column is zero. This
    corresponds to a particular spectral window and polarization
    setup. Note that the measurement set was opened for writing as
    well as reading. The third line reads all the weights and the
    data into the casapy variable rec. The weights are set
    to one. The more obscure syntax is used as typing 
    rec['weight'] = 1 will not preserve the shape of the weight
    array. The data then has its mean subtracted from
    it. The average function is defined in Numeric module. Finally the data
    is written back into the measurement set table. (NOTE: normally
    one should not modify the raw data column.  Such adjustments are more
    appropriate for the corrected_data column, if it exists.)

    This function concatenates two measurement sets together. 

    The data is copied from the measurement set specified in the
    msfile arguement to the end of the measurement set attached to the
    ms tool. If a lot of data needs to be copied this function may
    take some time. You need to open the measurement set for writing
    in order to use this function.

    This function acts like ms.concatenate() with handling==3 (do not concatenate
    the MAIN and POINTING tables). This is useful for generating, e.g.,
    SPECTRAL\_WINDOW and FIELD tables which contain all used SPW and FIELD ids
    for a set of MSs without having to actually carry out a time-consuming
    concatenation on disk. The MAIN table in the resulting output MS is
    that of the original MS, i.e. it is not touched. 
  </description>
  <example>
    
      tb.open("3C273XC1.MS")
      tb.copy("TEMP.MS", norows=True)

    This example makes a copy of the structure of an MS and then
    appends the subtables data from two  measurement sets to the empty structure. 
    Its going to assume a frequency tolerance of 1GHz and position tolerance

    This function virtually concatenates two measurement sets together
    such that they can later be turned into a multi-MS with createmultims(). 

    You need to open the measurement set for writing in order to use this function.

    This example virtually appends the data from the 3C273XC1-2 and 3C273XC1-3 to
    the end of the 3C273XC1 measurement set. Its going to assume a
    frequency tolerance of 1GHz and position tolerance of 1 arcsec in
    deciding if the spw and field in the measurementsets are
    similar or not. The file 3Caux.dat which is created in the process is
    no longer needed after the last call to virtconcatenate() and can

    NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET.  uvcontsub uses the cb tool for now.
    (The only reason to implement it in ms is to save time and disk space.)

    This function estimates the continuum emission of the MS and writes a MS
    with that estimate subtracted, using the ms tool.  The estimate is made,
    separately for the real and imaginary parts of each baseline, by fitting a
    low order polynomial to the unflagged visibilities selected by fitspw
    (depending on combine).
  </description>
  <example>
  
  ms.open("multiwin.ms")
  ms.contsub('contsub.ms', fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255', fitorder=0,
             field=[0], spw='0,2') 

  In this example the continuum estimates are made by seperately averaging
  channels 0:0~123;145~211 and 2:124~255, and the separate estimates are
  subtracted from spws 0 and 2.  The output only includes field 0 and spws 0
  and 2 (now called 1).

  ms.contsub('contsub.ms', fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255', fitorder=0,
             field=[0], combine='spw')
  ms.close()

  This time the estimate was made by simultaneously averaging channels
  0:0~123;145~211 and 2:124~255, and the continuum is subtracted from all the
  spws, including 1 (treated as a completely line-filled spw).  The output only
  includes field 0.

    NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

    This function estimates the noise from the scatter of the visibilities,
    sets SIGMA to it, and WEIGHT to SIGMA**-2.

    Ideally the visibilities used to estimate the scatter, as selected by
    fitspw and fitcorr, should be pure noise.  If you know for certain that
    they are, then setting dorms to True will give the best result.  Otherwise,
    use False (standard sample standard deviation).  More robust scatter
    estimates like the interquartile range or median absolute deviation from
    the median are not offered because they require sorting by value, which is
    not possible for complex numbers.

    To beat down the noise of the noise estimate, the sample size per estimate
    can be made larger than a single spw and baseline.  (Using combine='spw' is
    to interpolate between spws with line-free channels is recommended when an
    spw has no line-free channels.)  timebin smooths the noise estimate over
    time.  windowtype sets the type of time smoothing.

    WEIGHT and SIGMA will not be changed for samples that have fewer than
    minsamp visibilities.  Selected visibilities for which no noise estimate is
    made will be flagged.  Note that minsamp is effectively at least 2 if dorms
    is False, and 1 if it is True.

  </description>
  <example>
  
  ms.open("multiwin.ms", nomodify=False)
  ms.statwt(fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255', field=[0], spw='0,2') 

  In this example the noise estimates are seperately made from and applied 
  to spws 0 and 2.

  ms.statwt(fitspw='0:0~123;145~211,2:124~255', fitorder=0, field=[0],
            combine='spw')
  ms.close()

  This time the estimate for each baseline is made from the line-free channels
  of spws 0 and 2, and applied to all the spws, including 1 (which could be a
  completely line-filled spw).

  <description>
    This function splits out part of the MS into a new MS. Time and
    channel averaging can be performed in the process (but not in
    the same call).
    
    When splitting multiple spectral windows, the parameters {\tt
    nchan, start, step} can be vectors, so that each spectral window
    has its own selection on averaging and number of output
    channels. But the option of using only one value for each of these
    parameters means that it will be replicated for all the spectral
    windows selected.  
      
  </description>
  <example>
  
  ms.open("multiwin.ms")
  ms.split('subms.ms', field=[0], spw=[0], nchan=[10],
           start=[0], step=[5], whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA') 
  
  In this example we split out data from the 1st field and 1st
  spectral window. The output data will have 10 channels which is
  taken from 50 channels from the input data starting at channel 0 and
  averaging every 5.

      
  ms.open("multiwin.ms")
  ms.split('subms.ms', field=[0], spw=[0,1,2,3], nchan=[10],
           start=[0], step=[5], whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA') 
 
In this example we split out data from the 1st field and four spectral
windows. The output data will have 4 spectral windows each of 10
channels which is taken from 50 channels from the input data starting
at channel 0 and averaging every 5.

      
  ms.open("multiwin.ms")
  ms.split('subms.ms', field=[0], spw=[0,1,2,3], nchan=[10,10,30,40],
           start=[0,4,9,9], step=[1,10,5,2], whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA')

In this example we split out data from the 1st field and four spectral
windows. There will be four spectral windows in the output data,
with 10, 10, 30 and 40 channels respectively. These are averages
of the input spectral windows. The first output spectral window
will be formed by picking 10 channels, starting at 0 with no
averaging, of the input spwid 0. The second output spectral window
will consists of 10 channels and is formed by picking 100 channels
from spwid 1 of the input data, starting at channel 4, and every
10 channels to make one output channel.

     
  ms.open("WSRT.ms")
  ms.split('subms.ms', timebin='20s', whichcol='all', combine='scan')
  ms.close()

  This example averages a WSRT MS into 20s bins, selecting whichever of DATA,
  MODEL_DATA, CORRECTED_DATA, or FLOAT_DATA, or LAG_DATA is present.  Normally
  the bins would not cross scans, but in this MS the scan number goes up with
  each integration, making it redundant enough with time that it would defeat
  any time averaging.  Therefore the combine parameter forces the SCAN column
  to be ignored for setting the bins.

  <description>
    This function splits out part of the MS into a new MS. Time averaging can
    be performed in the process.  Unlike split, the subtables and IDs
    (ANTENNA1, DATA\_DESCRIPTION\_ID, etc.) are never changed to account for the
    selection.

    As a side effect of that property, partition cannot select by channel or
    correlation, or average channels.  It CAN select by spectral window(s).   
  </description>
  <example>
        
  ms.open("multiwin.ms")
  ms.partition('partition.ms', field=[0], spw=[1], whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA') 
  
  In this example we partition out data from the 1st field and 2nd spectral
  window.  Only the CORRECTED_DATA data column will be copied, and it will be
  written to the DATA column of partition.ms.
      

  ms.open("multiwin.ms")
  ms.partition('partition.ms', field=[0], spw=[0,1,2,3],
               whichcol='CORRECTED_DATA') 
 
  In this example we partition out calibrated data from the 1st field and four
  spectral windows.
      

  ms.open("WSRT.ms")
  ms.partition('partition.ms', timebin='20s', whichcol='all', combine='scan')
  ms.close()

  This example averages a WSRT MS into 20s bins, selecting whichever of DATA,
  MODEL_DATA, CORRECTED_DATA, or FLOAT_DATA, or LAG_DATA is present.  Normally
  the bins would not cross scans, but in this MS the scan number goes up with
  each integration, making it redundant enough with time that it would defeat
  any time averaging.  Therefore combine parameter forces the SCAN column to be
  ignored for setting the bins.

    to the specified columns: array\_id, field\_id, data\_desc\_id and
    time. This is so that the iterator can keep track of the
    coordinates associated with the data (field direction, frequency
    etc.) If you want to sort on these columns last instead of first
    you need to include them in the columns specified. If you don't
    want to sort on these columns at all, you can set

This function turns an MS tool into a FITS file containing an SDFITS
binary table.  This uses the \texttt{ms2sdfits} program to do the
conversion.  It converts the entire underlying measurement set file
even if the ms tool is the result of a selection.  This may be changed
in the future. The ms tool must consist of single dish data only.  A
brief description of SDFITS may be found in the
\htmladdnormallink{\textbf{dish} users

an SDFITS binary table will generally result in the loss of some
information which can not be represented in an SDFITS binary table.

This sets flags in the internal buffer based on the clip levels
specified. You can flag times, channels and individual pixels based on
their deviation from the median. The cliplevel is specified in units of
the corresponding average absolute deviation (a robust version of rms).

We open the MS for reading, select a subset and
read the data into the buffer. We then remove the average over a 15
point time window and clip the resulting data at 6 times the average
absolute deviation from the median for individual pixels, and at 5
times this for channels and timeslots.

   <description>
   If the MS is imported from an ASDM  with option lazy=True, the DATA column of the MS is virtual
   and directly reads the visibilities from the ASDM. A reference to the original ASDM is stored
   with the MS. If the ASDM needs to be moved to a different path, the reference to it in the MS
   needs to be updated. This can be achieved with ms.asdmref().
   When called with an empty string (default), the method just reports the currently set ASDM path.

   Return value is a string containing the new path if the path was successfully set or 
   (in the case abspath was empty) the MS indeed contains a ASDM reference, i.e. was lazily imported.

   If the ASDM does not contain an ASDM reference, the method returns an empty string.
   If abspath is not empty and there was an error setting the new reference, the method throws
   an exception.

     Set the path to the referenced ASDM to "/home/alma/myanalysis/uid___A12345_X678_X910":

  <description> 
This function provides a means of continuum determination and
subtraction by fitting a polynomial of desired order to a subset of
channels in each time-averaged uv spectrum.  The fit is used to model
the continuum in all channels (not just those used in the fit), for
subtraction, if desired.  Use the {\tt fitspw} parameter to limit the
spectral windows processed and the range of channels used to estimate 
the continuum  in each (avoid channels containing spectral lines).  The 
default solution interval 'int' will result in per-integration continuum
fits for each baseline.  The {\tt mode} parameter indicates 
how the continuum model (the result of the fit) should be used: 
{\tt 'subtract'} will store the continuum
model in the MODEL\_DATA column and subtract it from the CORRECTED\_DATA
column; {\tt 'replace'} will replace the CORRECTED\_DATA column with
the continuum model (useful if you want to image the continuum model
result); and {\tt 'model'} will only store the continuum model in the
MODEL\_DATA column (the CORRECTED\_DATA is unaffected).

It is important to start the ms tool with {\tt nomodify=False} so that
changes to the dataset will be allowed (see example below).

For now, the only way to recover the un-subtracted CORRECTED\_DATA column
is to use calibrater.correct() again.

Note that the MODEL\_DATA and CORRECTED\_DATA columns must be present
for {\tt continuumsub} to work correctly.  The function will warn the user
if they are not present, and abort.  To add these scratch columns (for
now), close the ms tool, then start a calibrater or an imager
tool, which will add the scratch columns.  Then restart the ms tool,
and try {\tt continuumsub} again.

Options for shifting known bright sources to the phase center and
for editing based on the rms fit will be added in the near future.

  </description>
  <example>
    
 ms.fromfits('ngc5921.ms','/aips++/data/demo/NGC5921.fits')
 ms.close()
 cb.open('ngc5921.ms')  # add MODEL_DATA, CORRECTED_DATA columns
 cb.close()
 ms.open('ngc5921.ms',nomodify=False);    # writable!
 ms.continuumsub(fldid=2,fitspw='0:5~9;50~59',
                 solint=0.0,fitorder=1,mode='sub')
 ms.done()
    
    This example will fit a linear continuum to channels 5-9 and 50-59 in 
    spectral window 0 in each scan-averaged spectrum for field 2, and 
    store the result in the MODEL\_DATA column and subtract it from the 
    CORRECTED\_DATA column.

  <description> 
This function averages the data over all (unflagged) times and (non-zero) 
baselines per field\_id and spectral\_window\_id, and reports the result in
the Stokes polarization basis.  If present, the CORRECTED\_DATA column is
averaged; otherwise the DATA column is used, in which case the results
might be suspect if this DATA hasn't been calibrated.

For multi-channel data, all channels are currently averaged as well.  
Future versions of this function will have options for channel selection.

This function is useful for obtaining a full-Stokes point source flux density
estimate for polarization calibration or other purposes.  It is essentially
calculating a single-pixel image at the observation's phase center, which
for point sources, yields the correct flux density.

      ms.open('ap366.ms'); 
      ms.ptsrc(fldid=[9,11],spwid=1)

  Field name '3C*', in this case 3C273, corresponds to field id 0.

  N.B.: The return values of unspecified fields (like antenna* and spw in the
        above example) will be left empty - this does not mean that selection
        excludes all antennas!

        Some fields (like 'field') are checked against the subtables of vis,
        but others are not.  For example, field='123~132' will produce an error
        if vis does not have fields 123 to 132, but for scan and obsids
        '123~132' would just return an array of integers from 123 to 132
        regardless of whether vis has those scan or observation IDs.  (The
        difference comes from it being quicker to check a subtable than the
        main table.)

  <description>
     This function generates moments from the MS data. It is only applicable 
     for single-dish MS, i.e., the MS must have FLOAT\_DATA column. Results are 
     stored separate MSs for each moment. The function returns a table object 
     of the MS that stores a first moment in its FLOAT\_DATA column.

     This is defined by analogy with ia.moments(). It allows to generate moments 
     along any axis (spectral axis, direction, and polarization), while ms.moments() 
     only accepts to generate moments along the spectral axis.

     The available moments are:

     \begin{itemize}
     \item{$-1$} -- the mean value of the spectrum 
     \begin{displaymath}
     { {1\over n}  {\sum {I_i}}}
     \end{displaymath}
     \medskip

     \item{0} -- the integrated value of the spectrum 
     \begin{displaymath}
     M_0 = \Delta v \sum I_i
     \end{displaymath}

     where $\Delta v$ is the width (in world coordinate units) of a pixel
     along the moment axis  
     \medskip

     traditionally used to get 'velocity fields')

     \begin{displaymath}
     M_1 = { {\sum {I_i v_i}} \over {M_0}}
     \end{displaymath}

     \item{2} -- the intensity weighted dispersion of the coordinate 
     (this is traditionally used to get 'velocity dispersion fields')

     \item{3} -- the median of $I$
     \medskip

     \item{4} -- the median coordinate.  Here we treat the spectrum as a
     probability distribution, generate the cumulative distribution, and then
     find the coordinate corresponding to the 50\% value.  This moment is not
     very robust, but it is useful for quickly generating a velocity field in
     a way that is not sensitive to noise.  However, it will only give
     sensible results under certain conditions.  The generation of the
     cumulative distribution and the finding of the 50\% level really only
     makes sense if the cumulative distribution is monotonic.  This
     essentially means only selecting pixels which are positive or negative. 
     For this reason, this moment type is only supported with the basic
     method (see below -- i.e.  no smoothing, no windowing, no fitting) with
     a pixel selection range that is either all positive, or all negative
     \medskip

     \item{5} -- the standard deviation about the mean of the spectrum 
     \begin{displaymath}
     \sqrt{ {1\over {\left(n-1\right)}}  \sum{\left(I_i - \bar{I}\right)^2 }}
     \end{displaymath}
     \medskip

     \item{6} -- the root mean square of the spectrum 
     \begin{displaymath}
     \sqrt{ {1 \over n} \sum{I_i^2}}
     \end{displaymath}
     \medskip

     \item{7} -- the absolute mean deviation of the spectrum 
     \begin{displaymath}
     {1 \over n} \sum {|(I_i - \bar{I})|}
     \end{displaymath}
     \medskip

     \item{8} -- the maximum value of the spectrum
     \medskip
     \item{9} -- the coordinate of the maximum value of the spectrum
     \medskip
     \item{10} -- the minimum value of the spectrum
     \medskip
     \item{11} -- the coordinate of the minimum value of the spectrum

       The serves redundant purpose and is here only for backward
       compatibility.
       
       This method returns True if there are no more iterations left.
       I.e., the iterations have ended.  This same information is also
       returned by niternext().

       With the use of the VisibilityIterator in the niterinit(),
       niterorigin(), niternext() methods, the iterator is set to the
       original state by calling niterinit() at any time.

       See the example below.
     </description>

     <example>
       ms.open("3C273XC1.MS")
       staql={'baseline':'1 &amp; 2'};
       ms.msselect(staql);
       ms.niterinit([" "],60.0)
       ms.niterorigin()
       while (!ms.niterend()):
          rec=ms.ngetdata(["u","v","data"])
          ms.niternext()
       ms.close()
       
       We open the MS, select a baseline and then specify an iteration
       over time, with a 60s time interval.  We then set the iterator
       to the start of the data and get out some data.  We advance the
       iterator to the next lot of data and continue till the end of
       iterations is indicated.  Finally, we close the ms tool which
       restores the tool to its original state.
